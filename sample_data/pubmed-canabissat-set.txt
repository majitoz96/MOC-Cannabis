AB  - Cannabis sativa (cannabis) produces a resin that is valued for its psychoactive and 
      medicinal properties. Despite being the foundation of a multi-billion dollar global 
      industry, scientific knowledge and research on cannabis is lagging behind compared 
      to other high-value crops. This is largely due to legal restrictions that have 
      prevented many researchers from studying cannabis, its products, and their effects 
      in humans. Cannabis resin contains hundreds of different terpene and cannabinoid 
      metabolites. Many of these metabolites have not been conclusively identified. Our 
      understanding of the genomic and biosynthetic systems of these metabolites in 
      cannabis, and the factors that affect their variability, is rudimentary. As a 
      consequence, there is concern about lack of consistency with regard to the terpene 
      and cannabinoid composition of different cannabis 'strains'. Likewise, claims of 
      some of the medicinal properties attributed to cannabis metabolites would benefit 
      from thorough scientific validation.

TI  - Epilepsy and cannabidiol: a guide to treatment.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1684/epd.2020.1141 [doi]
AB  - The growing interest in cannabidiol (CBD), specifically a pure form of CBD, as a 
      treatment for epilepsy, among other conditions, is reflected in recent changes in 
      legislation in some countries. Although there has been much speculation about the 
      therapeutic value of cannabis-based products as an anti-seizure treatment for some 
      time, it is only within the last two years that Class I evidence has been available 
      for a pure form of CBD, based on placebo-controlled RCTs for patients with 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. However, just as we are beginning to 
      understand the significance of CBD as a treatment for epilepsy, in recent years, a 
      broad spectrum of products advertised to contain CBD has emerged on the market. The 
      effects of these products are fundamentally dependent on the purity, preparation, 
      and concentration of CBD and other components, and consensus and standardisation are 
      severely lacking regarding their preparation, composition, usage and effectiveness. 
      This review aims to provide information to neurologists and epileptologists on the 
      therapeutic value of CBD products, principally a purified form, in routine practice 
      for patients with intractable epilepsy.

TI  - Cannabidiol: A Potential New Alternative for the Treatment of Anxiety, Depression, 
      and Psychotic Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/biom10111575 [doi]
LID - 1575
AB  - The potential therapeutic use of some Cannabis sativa plant compounds has been 
      attracting great interest, especially for managing neuropsychiatric disorders due to 
      the relative lack of efficacy of the current treatments. Numerous studies have been 
      carried out using the main phytocannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 
      cannabidiol (CBD). CBD displays an interesting pharmacological profile without the 
      potential for becoming a drug of abuse, unlike THC. In this review, we focused on 
      the anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antipsychotic effects of CBD found in animal and 
      human studies. In rodents, results suggest that the effects of CBD depend on the 
      dose, the strain, the administration time course (acute vs. chronic), and the route 
      of administration. In addition, certain key targets have been related with these CBD 
      pharmacological actions, including cannabinoid receptors (CB(1)r and CB(2)r), 
      5-HT(1A) receptor and neurogenesis factors. Preliminary clinical trials also support 
      the efficacy of CBD as an anxiolytic, antipsychotic, and antidepressant, and more 
      importantly, a positive risk-benefit profile. These promising results support the 
      development of large-scale studies to further evaluate CBD as a potential new drug 
      for the treatment of these psychiatric disorders.

LID - e0173911
AB  - Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) plants produce and accumulate a terpene-rich resin in 
      glandular trichomes, which are abundant on the surface of the female inflorescence. 
      Bouquets of different monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are important components of 
      cannabis resin as they define some of the unique organoleptic properties and may 
      also influence medicinal qualities of different cannabis strains and varieties. 
      Transcriptome analysis of trichomes of the cannabis hemp variety 'Finola' revealed 
      sequences of all stages of terpene biosynthesis. Nine cannabis terpene synthases 
      (CsTPS) were identified in subfamilies TPS-a and TPS-b. Functional characterization 
      identified mono- and sesqui-TPS, whose products collectively comprise most of the 
      terpenes of 'Finola' resin, including major compounds such as β-myrcene, 
      (E)-β-ocimene, (-)-limonene, (+)-α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. 
      Transcripts associated with terpene biosynthesis are highly expressed in trichomes 
      compared to non-resin producing tissues. Knowledge of the CsTPS gene family may 
      offer opportunities for selection and improvement of terpene profiles of interest in 
      different cannabis strains and varieties.

TI  - Cannabidiol for Pain Treatment: Focus on Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21228870 [doi]
LID - 8870
AB  - Cannabis has a long history of medical use. Although there are many cannabinoids 
      present in cannabis, Δ9tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the 
      two components found in the highest concentrations. CBD itself does not produce 
      typical behavioral cannabimimetic effects and was thought not to be responsible for 
      psychotropic effects of cannabis. Numerous anecdotal findings testify to the 
      therapeutic effects of CBD, which in some cases were further supported by research 
      findings. However, data regarding CBD's mechanism of action and therapeutic 
      potential are abundant and omnifarious. Therefore, we review the basic research 
      regarding molecular mechanism of CBD's action with particular focus on its analgesic 
      potential. Moreover, this article describes the detailed analgesic and 
      anti-inflammatory effects of CBD in various models, including neuropathic pain, 
      inflammatory pain, osteoarthritis and others. The dose and route of the 
      administration-dependent effect of CBD, on the reduction in pain, hyperalgesia or 
      allodynia, as well as the production of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, were 
      described depending on the disease model. The clinical applications of 
      CBD-containing drugs are also mentioned. The data presented herein unravel what is 
      known about CBD's pharmacodynamics and analgesic effects to provide the reader with 
      current state-of-art knowledge regarding CBD's action and future perspectives for 
      research.

AB  - The phytocannabinoids of Cannabis sativa L. have, since ancient times, been proposed 
      as a pharmacological alternative for treating various central nervous system (CNS) 
      disorders. Interestingly, cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) are highly expressed in the 
      basal ganglia (BG) circuit of both animals and humans. The BG are subcortical 
      structures that regulate the initiation, execution, and orientation of movement. 
      CBRs regulate dopaminergic transmission in the nigro-striatal pathway and, thus, the 
      BG circuit also. The functioning of the BG is affected in pathologies related to 
      movement disorders, especially those occurring in Parkinson's disease (PD), which 
      produces motor and non-motor symptoms that involving GABAergic, glutamatergic, and 
      dopaminergic neural networks. To date, the most effective medication for PD is 
      levodopa (l-DOPA); however, long-term levodopa treatment causes a type of long-term 
      dyskinesias, l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). With neuromodulation offering a 
      novel treatment strategy for PD patients, research has focused on the 
      endocannabinoid system (ECS), as it participates in the physiological 
      neuromodulation of the BG in order to control movement. CBRs have been shown to 
      inhibit neurotransmitter release, while endocannabinoids (eCBs) play a key role in 
      the synaptic regulation of the BG. In the past decade, cannabidiol (CBD), a 
      non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid, has been shown to have compensatory effects both 
      on the ECS and as a neuromodulator and neuroprotector in models such as 
      6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and 
      reserpine, as well as other PD models. Although the CBD-induced neuroprotection 
      observed in animal models of PD has been attributed to the activation of the CB1 
      receptor, recent research conducted at a molecular level has proposed that CBD is 
      capable of activating other receptors, such as CB2 and the TRPV-1 receptor, both of 
      which are expressed in the dopaminergic neurons of the nigro-striatal pathway. These 
      findings open new lines of scientific inquiry into the effects of CBD at the level 
      of neural communication. Cannabidiol activates the PPARγ, GPR55, GPR3, GPR6, GPR12, 
      and GPR18 receptors, causing a variety of biochemical, molecular, and behavioral 
      effects due to the broad range of receptors it activates in the CNS. Given the low 
      number of pharmacological treatment alternatives for PD currently available, the 
      search for molecules with the therapeutic potential to improve neuronal 
      communication is crucial. Therefore, the investigation of CBD and the mechanisms 
      involved in its function is required in order to ascertain whether receptor 
      activation could be a treatment alternative for both PD and LID.

AB  - Interactions between plants and microbes may promote the growth of plants and 
      regulate the production of secondary metabolites. Hemp (Cannabis sativa) is an 
      annual herb and an important commercial crop. However, the assembly and network of 
      hemp-associated microbiomes inhabiting in soil and plant compartments have not been 
      comprehensively understood. This work investigated the assembly and network of 
      bacterial and fungal communities living in soils (bulk and rhizosphere) and plant 
      compartments (root, stem, leaf, and flower) of four hemp ecotypes cultivated in the 
      same habitat. Microbiome assembly was predominantly shaped by compartment niche. 
      Microbial alpha diversity was the highest in soil, continually decreased from root 
      to flower. Core bacterial genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhizobium, Planococcus, and 
      Sphingomonas were mostly enriched in aerial endosphere niches; Clitopilus, 
      Plectosphaerella, and Mortierella were enriched in belowground endosphere. Microbial 
      network complexity and connectivity decreased from root to flower. According to 
      source tracking analysis, hemp microbiota primarily originated from soil and were 
      subsequently filtered in different plant compartments. This work provides details on 
      hemp-associated microbiome along the soil-plant continuum and a comprehensive 
      understanding of the origin and transmission mode of endophytes in hemp.

TI  - Cannabinoid Toxicity.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Cannabinoids are a collective group of compounds that act on cannabinoid receptors. 
      They include plant-derived phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids, and 
      endogenously-derived endocannabinoids. The primary source of cannabinoid toxicity is 
      from plant-derived cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids. These agents act as 
      cannabinoid receptor agonists. More than 60 naturally occurring cannabinoids are 
      found in the Sativa and Indica species of Cannabis, with delta-9 
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the main psychoactive compound. Other naturally 
      occurring cannabinoids include cannabidiol and cannabinol. Marijuana is the most 
      common colloquial name for crushed, dried leaves and flowers of the Cannabis plant. 
      In recent years, there have been many reports of marijuana toxicity, primarily in 
      the pediatric population, as medical and recreational marijuana has been legalized. 
      The terms phytocannabinoids, marijuana and cannabis are used interchangeably. 
      Synthetic cannabinoids were created for therapeutic and research purposes; however, 
      despite legal efforts to limit their availability, synthetic cannabinoids have 
      become an increasingly common drug of abuse, sold under various street names such as 
      K2, Spice, and Black Mamba. Synthetic cannabinoids are associated with much more 
      morbidity and mortality than the phytocannabinoids. Prescription preparations for 
      medical usage include dronabinol, or pure THC, nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, 
      and cannabidiol (CBD). Pharmaceutical use of cannabinoids is an ongoing field of 
      research.

AB  - Objective To assess the feasibility of the rbcL sequence of chloroplast DNA as a 
      genetic marker to identify Cannabis sativa L. Methods The rbcL sequences in 62 
      Cannabis sativa L. samples, 10 Humulus lupulus samples and 10 Humulus scandens DNA 
      samples were detected, and 96 rbcL sequences of the Cannabaceae family were 
      downloaded from Genbank. Sequence alignment was performed by MEGA X software, the 
      intraspecific and interspecific Kimura-2-Parameter （K2P） genetic distances were 
      calculated, and the system clustering tree was constructed. Results The rbcL 
      sequence length acquired by sequencing of Cannabis sativa L. and Humulus scandens 
      were 617 bp and 649 bp, respectively, and two haplotypes of Cannabis sativa L. were 
      observed in the samples. The BLAST similarity search results showed that the highest 
      similarity between the sequences acquired by sequencing and Cannabis sativa L. rbcL 
      sequences available from Genbank was 100%. The genetic distance analysis showed that 
      the maximum intraspecific genetic distance （0.004 9） of Cannabis sativa L. was less 
      than the minimum interspecific genetic distance （0.012 9）. The results of 
      median-joining network and system clustering tree analysis showed that Cannabis 
      sativa L. and other members of the Cannabaceae family were located in different 
      branches. Conclusion The rbcL sequence could be used as a DNA barcode for 
      identifying Cannabis sativa L., and combined with comparative analysis of the rbcL 
      sequence and system cluster analysis could be a reliable and effective detection 
      method for Cannabis sativa L. identification in forensic investigation.

TI  - It Is Our Turn to Get Cannabis High: Put Cannabinoids in Food and Health Baskets.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25184036 [doi]
LID - 4036
AB  - Cannabis is an annual plant with a long history of use as food, feed, fiber, oil, 
      medicine, and narcotics. Despite realizing its true value, it has not yet found its 
      true place. Cannabis has had a long history with many ups and downs, and now it is 
      our turn to promote it. Cannabis contains approximately 600 identified and many yet 
      unidentified potentially useful compounds. Cannabinoids, phenolic compounds, 
      terpenoids, and alkaloids are some of the secondary metabolites present in cannabis. 
      However, among a plethora of unique chemical compounds found in this plant, the most 
      important ones are phytocannabinoids (PCs). Over hundreds of 21-22-carbon compounds 
      exclusively produce in cannabis glandular hairs through either polyketide and or 
      deoxyxylulose phosphate/methylerythritol phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathways. 
      Trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are those that first 
      come to mind while talking about cannabis. Nevertheless, despite the low 
      concentration, cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), 
      tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabinodiol (CBND), and 
      cannabinidiol (CBDL) may have potentially some medical effects. PCs and 
      endocannabinoids (ECs) mediate their effects mainly through CB1 and CB2 receptors. 
      Despite all concerns regarding cannabis, nobody can ignore the use of cannabinoids 
      as promising tonic, analgesic, antipyretic, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, 
      anti-epileptic, anticancer agents, which are effective for pain relief, depression, 
      anxiety, sleep disorders, nausea and vomiting, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular 
      disorders, and appetite stimulation. The scientific community and public society 
      have now increasingly accepted cannabis specifically hemp as much more than a 
      recreational drug. There are growing demands for cannabinoids, mainly CBD, with many 
      diverse therapeutic and nutritional properties in veterinary or human medicine. The 
      main objective of this review article is to historically summarize findings 
      concerning cannabinoids, mainly THC and CBD, towards putting these valuable 
      compounds into food, feed and health baskets and current and future trends in the 
      consumption of products derived from cannabis.

AB  - CONTEXT: With increased use of cannabis-based products by the public for both 
      recreational and medical use, sports medicine clinicians should be informed of 
      historical context, current legal considerations, and existing evidence with regard 
      to efficacy, safety, and risks in the athletic community. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A 
      review of ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, and CINAHL from 2015 to present was conducted 
      with emphasis on the most recent literature using search terms, cannabis, 
      nabiximols, cannabinoids, pain management, THC, CBD, and marijuana. Bibliographies 
      based on original search were utilized to pursue further literature search. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. RESULTS: At present, limited 
      high-quality studies exist for use of cannabinoids for acute pain, chronic pain, or 
      concussion. None of the trials involving cannabinoids included the athletic 
      population. Thus, results from this clinical review are extrapolated to conditions 
      of the sports medicine population. For acute pain, 2 small-randomized double-blinded 
      crossover trials concluded no immediate effect of cannabinoid therapy. More robust 
      evidence exists for treatment of chronic pain conditions through meta-analysis and 
      systemic reviews. Cannabinoid therapy exhibits moderate efficacy as a treatment for 
      some chronic pain conditions. Investigations included a broad spectrum of chronic 
      pain conditions, including neuropathic, musculoskeletal, inflammatory, and central 
      pain conditions, and reveal reduction in pain and improvement of quality of life 
      with limited adverse effects. For concussion, evidence is based on preclinical in 
      vitro and animal models revealing possible neuroprotective effects as well as 2 
      clinical studies involving the presence of cannabinoids for concussion (some 
      sports-related), but there are no high-quality trials evaluating efficacy for 
      treatment with cannabinoids at this time. CONCLUSION: Although various biochemical 
      explanations exist on the use of cannabinoid therapy through modulation of the 
      endocannabinoid system for several medical issues affecting athletes, 
      recommendations from clinicians must be extrapolated from a majority of research 
      done in the nonathletic population. Lack of strong-quality clinical evidence, 
      coupled with inconsistent federal and state law as well as purity issues with 
      cannabis-based products, make it difficult for the sports medicine clinician to 
      widely recommend cannabinoid therapeutics at present. Future larger, higher quality 
      clinical research studies with standardized pure extracts will better guide 
      appropriate medical use going forward. At present, evidence for a multitude of 
      therapeutic applications is emerging for cannabinoid treatment approaches. With 
      emphasis placed on patient-centered clinical decisions, cannabinoids hold promise of 
      treatment for athletes with chronic pain conditions. Clinicians who treat the 
      athletic community must consider legal and ethical issues when discussing and 
      recommending the use of cannabinoids, with acknowledgment of inconsistencies in 
      purity of various formulations and concerns of drug testing.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of global cancer incidence and mortality, 
      accounting for an estimated 2 million diagnoses and 1.8 million deaths. Neoplasms of 
      the lungs are the second most common cancer diagnosis in men and women (after 
      prostate and breast cancer, respectively). With increasing access to tobacco and 
      industrialization in developing nations, lung cancer incidence is rising globally. 
      The average age of diagnosis is 70 years old. Men are twice as likely to be 
      diagnosed with lung cancer, which largely reflects differences in tobacco 
      consumption, although women may be more susceptible due to higher proportions of 
      epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and the effects of oestrogen. African 
      American men in the US are at the highest risk of lung cancer. Family history 
      increases risk by 1.7-fold, with a greater risk among first-degree relatives. 
      Tobacco smoking is the greatest preventable cause of death worldwide, accounting for 
      up to 90% of lung cancer cases, and continued consumption is projected to increase 
      global cancer incidence, particularly in developing nations such as China, Russia, 
      and India. Second-hand smoke among children and spouses has likewise been 
      implicated. Radon from natural underground uranium decay is the second leading cause 
      of lung cancer in the developed world. Occupational hazards such as asbestos and 
      environmental exposures such as air pollution, arsenic, and HIV and Tb infection 
      have all been implicated in lung carcinogenesis, while cannabis smoking, electronic 
      cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and COVID-19 have been hypothesized to increase 
      risk.

TI  - Pharmacological Treatment of Methamphetamine/Amphetamine Dependence: A Systematic 
      Review.
PG  - 337-365
LID - 10.1007/s40263-020-00711-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stimulant drugs are second only to cannabis as the most widely used 
      class of illicit drug globally, accounting for 68 million past-year consumers. 
      Dependence on amphetamines (AMPH) or methamphetamine (MA) is a growing global 
      concern. Yet, there is no established pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence. A 
      comprehensive assessment of the research literature on pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA 
      dependence may inform treatment guidelines and future research directions. METHODS: 
      We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature via the electronic databases 
      PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for randomised controlled trials reported in the 
      English language examining a pharmacological treatment for AMPH/MA dependence or use 
      disorder. We included all studies published to 19 June 2019. The selected studies 
      were evaluated for design; methodology; inclusion and exclusion criteria; sample 
      size; pharmacological and (if included) psychosocial interventions; length of 
      follow-up and follow-up schedules; outcome variables and measures; results; overall 
      conclusions and risk of bias. Outcome measures were any reported impact of treatment 
      related to AMPH/MA use. RESULTS: Our search returned 43 studies that met our 
      criteria, collectively enrolling 4065 participants and reporting on 23 individual 
      pharmacotherapies, alone or in combination. Disparate outcomes and measures (n = 55 
      for the primary outcomes) across studies did not allow for meta-analyses. Some 
      studies demonstrated mixed or weak positive signals (often in defined populations, 
      e.g. men who have sex with men), with some variation in efficacy signals dependent 
      on baseline frequency of AMPH/MA use. The most consistent positive findings have 
      been demonstrated with stimulant agonist treatment (dexamphetamine and 
      methylphenidate), naltrexone and topiramate. Less consistent benefits have been 
      shown with the antidepressants bupropion and mirtazapine, the glutamatergic agent 
      riluzole and the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF-1) antagonist pexacerfont; 
      whilst in general, antidepressant medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors [SSRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) have not been effective in 
      reducing AMPH/MA use. CONCLUSIONS: No pharmacotherapy yielded convincing results for 
      the treatment of AMPH/MA dependence; mostly studies were underpowered and had low 
      treatment completion rates. However, there were positive signals from several agents 
      that warrant further investigation in larger scale studies; agonist therapies show 
      promise. Common outcome measures should include change in use days. Future research 
      must address the heterogeneity of AMPH/MA dependence (e.g. coexisting conditions, 
      severity of disorder, differences between MA and AMPH dependence) and the role of 
      psychosocial intervention.

TI  - The Impact of Cannabidiol on Human Brain Function: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 618184
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2020.618184 [doi]
LID - 618184
AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that the non-intoxicating cannabinoid 
      compound cannabidiol (CBD) may have antipsychotic and anxiolytic properties, and 
      thus may be a promising new agent in the treatment of psychotic and anxiety 
      disorders. However, the neurobiological substrates underlying the potential 
      therapeutic effects of CBD are still unclear. The aim of this systematic review is 
      to provide a detailed and up-to-date systematic literature overview of neuroimaging 
      studies that investigated the acute impact of CBD on human brain function. Methods: 
      Papers published until May 2020 were included from PubMed following a comprehensive 
      search strategy and pre-determined set of criteria for article selection. We 
      included studies that examined the effects of CBD on brain function of healthy 
      volunteers and individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, comprising both 
      the effects of CBD alone as well as in direct comparison to those induced by 
      ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of Cannabis. Results: 
      One-ninety four studies were identified, of which 17 met inclusion criteria. All 
      studies investigated the acute effects of CBD on brain function during resting state 
      or in the context of cognitive tasks. In healthy volunteers, acute CBD enhanced 
      fronto-striatal resting state connectivity, both compared to placebo and THC. 
      Furthermore, CBD modulated brain activity and had opposite effects when compared to 
      THC following task-specific patterns during various cognitive paradigms, such as 
      emotional processing (fronto-temporal), verbal memory (fronto-striatal), response 
      inhibition (fronto-limbic-striatal), and auditory/visual processing 
      (temporo-occipital). In individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis and patients 
      with established psychosis, acute CBD showed intermediate brain activity compared to 
      placebo and healthy controls during cognitive task performance. CBD modulated 
      resting limbic activity in subjects with anxiety and metabolite levels in patients 
      with autism spectrum disorders. Conclusion: Neuroimaging studies have shown that 
      acute CBD induces significant alterations in brain activity and connectivity 
      patterns during resting state and performance of cognitive tasks in both healthy 
      volunteers and patients with a psychiatric disorder. This included modulation of 
      functional networks relevant for psychiatric disorders, possibly reflecting CBD's 
      therapeutic effects. Future studies should consider replication of findings and 
      enlarge the inclusion of psychiatric patients, combining longer-term CBD treatment 
      with neuroimaging assessments.

AB  - Cannabis extracts in oil are becoming increasingly available, and, during the last 
      years, there has been growing public and scientific interest about therapeutic 
      properties of these compounds for the treatment of several neurologic diseases, not 
      just epilepsy. The discovered role of the endocannabinoid system in epileptogenesis 
      has provided the basis to investigate the pharmacological use of exogenously 
      produced cannabinoids, to treat epilepsy. Although, physicians show reluctance to 
      recommend Cannabis extracts given the lack of high-quality safety available data, 
      from literature data cannabidiol (CBD) results to be a promising and safe 
      anticonvulsant drug with low side-effect. In particular, according to early studies, 
      CBD can reduce the frequency of seizures and lead to improvements in quality of life 
      in children affected by refractory epilepsy. So, for these reasons, the detailed 
      study of the interactions between CBD and anticonvulsant drugs (AEDs) administered 
      simultaneously in polytherapy, is arousing increasing interest, to clarify and to 
      assess the incidence of adverse effects and the relation between dose escalation and 
      quality of life measures. To date, in pediatric age, CBD efficacy and safety is not 
      supported by well-designed trials and strong scientific evidence are not available. 
      These studies are either retrospective or small-scale observational and only during 
      the last years Class I evidence data for a pure form of CBD have been available, as 
      demonstrated in placebo-controlled RCTs for patients affected by Lennox-Gastaut 
      syndrome and Dravet syndrome. It is necessary to investigate CBD safety, 
      pharmacokinetics and interaction with other AEDs alongside performing double-blinded 
      placebo-controlled trials to obtain conclusive data on its efficacy and safety in 
      the most frequent epilepsies in children, not just in the epileptic encephalopathy. 
      This review was aimed to revise the available data to describe the scientific 
      evidence for CBD in Pediatric Epilepsies.

TI  - Epigenomic Dysregulation in Schizophrenia: In Search of Disease Etiology and 
      Biomarkers.
LID - 10.3390/cells9081837 [doi]
LID - 1837
AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a complex array of signs and 
      symptoms that causes very significant disability in young people. While 
      schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, with heritability around 80%, there is 
      also a very significant range of environmental exposures and stressors that have 
      been implicated in disease development and neuropathology, such as maternal immune 
      infection, obstetric complications, childhood trauma and cannabis exposure. It is 
      postulated that epigenetic factors, as well as regulatory non-coding RNAs, mediate 
      the effects of these environmental stressors. In this review, we explore the most 
      well-known epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation and histone modification, 
      along with emerging RNA mediators of epigenomic state, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, 
      and discuss their collective potential for involvement in the pathophysiology of 
      schizophrenia implicated through the postmortem analysis of brain tissue. Given that 
      peripheral tissues, such as blood, saliva, and olfactory epithelium have the same 
      genetic composition and are exposed to many of the same environmental exposures, we 
      also examine some studies supporting the application of peripheral tissues for 
      epigenomic biomarker discovery in schizophrenia. Finally, we provide some 
      perspective on how these biomarkers may be utilized to capture a signature of past 
      events that informs future treatment.

TI  - Association of Cannabis With Cognitive Functioning in Adolescents and Young Adults: 
      A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 585-595
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0335 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Substantial shifts in perception and policy regarding cannabis have 
      recently occurred, with use of cannabis increasing while its perceived harm 
      decreases. One possible risk of increased cannabis use is poorer cognitive 
      functioning, especially in youth. OBJECTIVE: To provide the first quantitative 
      synthesis of the literature examining cannabis and cognitive functioning in 
      adolescents and young adults (with a mean age of 26 years and younger). DATA 
      SOURCES: PubMed, PsycInfo, Academic Search Premier, Scopus, and bibliographies of 
      relevant reviews were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language studies from the 
      date the databases began through May 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Consensus criteria were 
      used to determine study inclusion through abstract and manuscript review. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This study followed Meta-analysis of Observational Studies 
      in Epidemiology guidelines. Effect size estimates were calculated using multivariate 
      mixed-effects models for cognitive functioning outcomes classified into 10 domains. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Results from neurocognitive tests administered in 
      cross-sectional studies were primary outcomes, and we examined the influence of a 
      priori explanatory variables on variability in effect size. RESULTS: Sixty-nine 
      studies of 2152 cannabis users (mean [SD] age, 20.6 [2.8] years; 1472 [68.4%] male) 
      and 6575 comparison participants with minimal cannabis exposure were included (mean 
      [SD] age, 20.8 [3.4]; 3669 [55.8%] male). Results indicated a small overall effect 
      size (presented as mean d) for reduced cognitive functioning associated with 
      frequent or heavy cannabis use (d, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.17; P < .001). The 
      magnitude of effect sizes did not vary by sample age or age at cannabis use onset. 
      However, studies requiring an abstinence period longer than 72 hours (15 studies; 
      n = 928) had an overall effect size (d, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.07) that was not 
      significantly different from 0 and smaller than studies with less stringent 
      abstinence criteria (54 studies; n = 7799; d, -0.30; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.22; 
      P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Associations between cannabis use and cognitive 
      functioning in cross-sectional studies of adolescents and young adults are small and 
      may be of questionable clinical importance for most individuals. Furthermore, 
      abstinence of longer than 72 hours diminishes cognitive deficits associated with 
      cannabis use. Although other outcomes (eg, psychosis) were not examined in the 
      included studies, results indicate that previous studies of cannabis in youth may 
      have overstated the magnitude and persistence of cognitive deficits associated with 
      use. Reported deficits may reflect residual effects from acute use or withdrawal. 
      Future studies should examine individual differences in susceptibility to 
      cannabis-associated cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - Opioids for Chronic Noncancer Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 2448-2460
LID - 10.1001/jama.2018.18472 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Harms and benefits of opioids for chronic noncancer pain remain unclear. 
      OBJECTIVE: To systematically review randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of opioids for 
      chronic noncancer pain. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: The databases of CENTRAL, 
      CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, AMED, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to April 
      2018 for RCTs of opioids for chronic noncancer pain vs any nonopioid control. DATA 
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Paired reviewers independently extracted data. The 
      analyses used random-effects models and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
      Development and Evaluation to rate the quality of the evidence. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcomes were pain intensity (score range, 0-10 cm on a visual 
      analog scale for pain; lower is better and the minimally important difference [MID] 
      is 1 cm), physical functioning (score range, 0-100 points on the 36-item Short Form 
      physical component score [SF-36 PCS]; higher is better and the MID is 5 points), and 
      incidence of vomiting. RESULTS: Ninety-six RCTs including 26 169 participants (61% 
      female; median age, 58 years [interquartile range, 51-61 years]) were included. Of 
      the included studies, there were 25 trials of neuropathic pain, 32 trials of 
      nociceptive pain, 33 trials of central sensitization (pain present in the absence of 
      tissue damage), and 6 trials of mixed types of pain. Compared with placebo, opioid 
      use was associated with reduced pain (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.69 cm [95% 
      CI, -0.82 to -0.56 cm] on a 10-cm visual analog scale for pain; modeled risk 
      difference for achieving the MID, 11.9% [95% CI, 9.7% to 14.1%]), improved physical 
      functioning (WMD, 2.04 points [95% CI, 1.41 to 2.68 points] on the 100-point SF-36 
      PCS; modeled risk difference for achieving the MID, 8.5% [95% CI, 5.9% to 11.2%]), 
      and increased vomiting (5.9% with opioids vs 2.3% with placebo for trials that 
      excluded patients with adverse events during a run-in period). Low- to 
      moderate-quality evidence suggested similar associations of opioids with 
      improvements in pain and physical functioning compared with nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (pain: WMD, -0.60 cm [95% CI, -1.54 to 0.34 cm]; physical 
      functioning: WMD, -0.90 points [95% CI, -2.69 to 0.89 points]), tricyclic 
      antidepressants (pain: WMD, -0.13 cm [95% CI, -0.99 to 0.74 cm]; physical 
      functioning: WMD, -5.31 points [95% CI, -13.77 to 3.14 points]), and anticonvulsants 
      (pain: WMD, -0.90 cm [95% CI, -1.65 to -0.14 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, 0.45 
      points [95% CI, -5.77 to 6.66 points]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 
      meta-analysis of RCTs of patients with chronic noncancer pain, evidence from 
      high-quality studies showed that opioid use was associated with statistically 
      significant but small improvements in pain and physical functioning, and increased 
      risk of vomiting compared with placebo. Comparisons of opioids with nonopioid 
      alternatives suggested that the benefit for pain and functioning may be similar, 
      although the evidence was from studies of only low to moderate quality.

PG  - 2493-2503
LID - 10.1038/s41380-018-0339-3 [doi]
AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a severely impairing 
      neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 5% in children and adolescents and 
      of 2.5% in adults. Comorbid conditions in ADHD play a key role in symptom 
      progression, disorder course and outcome. ADHD is associated with a significantly 
      increased risk for substance use, abuse and dependence. ADHD and cannabis use are 
      partly determined by genetic factors; the heritability of ADHD is estimated at 
      70-80% and of cannabis use initiation at 40-48%. In this study, we used summary 
      statistics from the largest available meta-analyses of genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS) of ADHD (n = 53,293) and lifetime cannabis use (n = 32,330) to gain 
      insights into the genetic overlap and causal relationship of these two traits. We 
      estimated their genetic correlation to be r(2) = 0.29 (P = 1.63 × 10(-5)) and 
      identified four new genome-wide significant loci in a cross-trait analysis: two in a 
      single variant association analysis (rs145108385, P = 3.30 × 10(-8) and rs4259397, 
      P = 4.52 × 10(-8)) and two in a gene-based association analysis (WDPCP, 
      P = 9.67 × 10(-7) and ZNF251, P = 1.62 × 10(-6)). Using a two-sample Mendelian 
      randomization approach we found support that ADHD is causal for lifetime cannabis 
      use, with an odds ratio of 7.9 for cannabis use in individuals with ADHD in 
      comparison to individuals without ADHD (95% CI (3.72, 15.51), P = 5.88 × 10(-5)). 
      These results substantiate the temporal relationship between ADHD and future 
      cannabis use and reinforce the need to consider substance misuse in the context of 
      ADHD in clinical interventions.

TI  - The contribution of cannabis use to variation in the incidence of psychotic disorder 
      across Europe (EU-GEI): a multicentre case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of later psychotic 
      disorder but whether it affects incidence of the disorder remains unclear. We aimed 
      to identify patterns of cannabis use with the strongest effect on odds of psychotic 
      disorder across Europe and explore whether differences in such patterns contribute 
      to variations in the incidence rates of psychotic disorder. METHODS: We included 
      patients aged 18-64 years who presented to psychiatric services in 11 sites across 
      Europe and Brazil with first-episode psychosis and recruited controls representative 
      of the local populations. We applied adjusted logistic regression models to the data 
      to estimate which patterns of cannabis use carried the highest odds for psychotic 
      disorder. Using Europe-wide and national data on the expected concentration of 
      Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the different types of cannabis available across 
      the sites, we divided the types of cannabis used by participants into two 
      categories: low potency (THC <10%) and high potency (THC ≥10%). Assuming causality, 
      we calculated the population attributable fractions (PAFs) for the patterns of 
      cannabis use associated with the highest odds of psychosis and the correlation 
      between such patterns and the incidence rates for psychotic disorder across the 
      study sites. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2010, and April 1, 2015, we obtained data from 
      901 patients with first-episode psychosis across 11 sites and 1237 population 
      controls from those same sites. Daily cannabis use was associated with increased 
      odds of psychotic disorder compared with never users (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3·2, 
      95% CI 2·2-4·1), increasing to nearly five-times increased odds for daily use of 
      high-potency types of cannabis (4·8, 2·5-6·3). The PAFs calculated indicated that if 
      high-potency cannabis were no longer available, 12·2% (95% CI 3·0-16·1) of cases of 
      first-episode psychosis could be prevented across the 11 sites, rising to 30·3% 
      (15·2-40·0) in London and 50·3% (27·4-66·0) in Amsterdam. The adjusted incident 
      rates for psychotic disorder were positively correlated with the prevalence in 
      controls across the 11 sites of use of high-potency cannabis (r = 0·7; p=0·0286) and 
      daily use (r = 0·8; p=0·0109). INTERPRETATION: Differences in frequency of daily 
      cannabis use and in use of high-potency cannabis contributed to the striking 
      variation in the incidence of psychotic disorder across the 11 studied sites. Given 
      the increasing availability of high-potency cannabis, this has important 
      implications for public health. FUNDING SOURCE: Medical Research Council, the

AB  - Addictovigilance is a safety monitoring targeted at substances with potential for 
      abuse and dependence. This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 
      epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological 
      disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the 
      different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration 
      with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of 
      potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were 
      identified through the continuity of the networking between the French 
      addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general 
      practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown 
      began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly 
      with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive 
      codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other 
      relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the 
      many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, 
      cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, 
      seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant 
      decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies 
      continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an 
      increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, 
      the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the 
      period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, 
      and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French 
      Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19). 
      COVID-19 epidemic has been an important challenge for addictovigilance, and has 
      proved that this monitoring is highly essential for alerting health professionals 
      and health authorities to points of vigilance in the field of psychoactive 
      substances.

TI  - Cannabis analgesia in chronic neuropathic pain is associated with altered brain 
      connectivity.
PG  - e1285-e1294
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006293 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the functional brain changes involved in 
      δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) modulation of chronic neuropathic pain. METHODS: 
      Fifteen patients with chronic radicular neuropathic pain participated in a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial employing a counterbalanced, 
      within-subjects design. Pain assessments and functional resting state brain scans 
      were performed at baseline and after sublingual THC administration. We examined 
      functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and pain-related 
      network dynamics using graph theory measures. RESULTS: THC significantly reduced 
      patients' pain compared to placebo. THC-induced analgesia was correlated with a 
      reduction in functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and 
      the sensorimotor cortex. Moreover, the degree of reduction was predictive of the 
      response to THC. Graph theory analyses of local measures demonstrated reduction in 
      network connectivity in areas involved in pain processing, and specifically in the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which were correlated with individual pain 
      reduction. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the ACC and DLPFC, 2 major 
      cognitive-emotional modulation areas, and their connections to somatosensory areas, 
      are functionally involved in the analgesic effect of THC in chronic pain. This 
      effect may therefore be mediated through induction of functional disconnection 
      between regulatory high-order affective regions and the sensorimotor cortex. 
      Moreover, baseline functional connectivity between these brain areas may serve as a 
      predictor for the extent of pain relief induced by THC.

TI  - Consensus recommendations on dosing and administration of medical cannabis to treat 
      chronic pain: results of a modified Delphi process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, medical cannabis legalization has increased in recent years 
      and medical cannabis is commonly used to treat chronic pain. However, there are few 
      randomized control trials studying medical cannabis indicating expert guidance on 
      how to dose and administer medical cannabis safely and effectively is needed. 
      METHODS: Using a multistage modified Delphi process, twenty global experts across 
      nine countries developed consensus-based recommendations on how to dose and 
      administer medical cannabis in patients with chronic pain. RESULTS: There was 
      consensus that medical cannabis may be considered for patients experiencing 
      neuropathic, inflammatory, nociplastic, and mixed pain. Three treatment protocols 
      were developed. A routine protocol where the clinician initiates the patient on a 
      CBD-predominant variety at a dose of 5 mg CBD twice daily and titrates the 
      CBD-predominant dose by 10 mg every 2 to 3 days until the patient reaches their 
      goals, or up to 40 mg/day. At a CBD-predominant dose of 40 mg/day, clinicians may 
      consider adding THC at 2.5 mg and titrate by 2.5 mg every 2 to 7 days until a 
      maximum daily dose of 40 mg/day of THC. A conservative protocol where the clinician 
      initiates the patient on a CBD-predominant variety at a dose of 5 mg once daily and 
      titrates the CBD-predominant dose by 10 mg every 2 to 3 days until the patient 
      reaches their goals, or up to 40 mg/day. At a CBD-predominant dose of 40 mg/day, 
      clinicians may consider adding THC at 1 mg/day and titrate by 1 mg every 7 days 
      until a maximum daily dose of 40 mg/day of THC. A rapid protocol where the clinician 
      initiates the patient on a balanced THC:CBD variety at 2.5-5 mg of each cannabinoid 
      once or twice daily and titrates by 2.5-5 mg of each cannabinoid every 2 to 3 days 
      until the patient reaches his/her goals or to a maximum THC dose of 40 mg/day. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In summary, using a modified Delphi process, expert consensus-based 
      recommendations were developed on how to dose and administer medical cannabis for 
      the treatment of patients with chronic pain.

TI  - Shared genetic risk between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes: 
      Evidence from genome-wide association studies.
PG  - e12880
LID - 10.1111/adb.12880 [doi]
AB  - Eating disorders and substance use disorders frequently co-occur. Twin studies 
      reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance 
      use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa and problem 
      alcohol use (genetic correlation [r(g) ], twin-based = 0.23-0.53). We estimated the 
      genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder 
      phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating 
      disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge eating, AN without binge 
      eating, and a bulimia nervosa factor score), and eight substance-use-related 
      phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current 
      smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis 
      use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations 
      were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder and 
      schizophrenia. Total study sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2400 to ~537 000 
      individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single 
      nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder- and 
      substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged 
      between AUD and AN (r(g) = 0.18; false discovery rate q = 0.0006), cannabis 
      initiation and AN (r(g) = 0.23; q < 0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with 
      binge eating (r(g) = 0.27; q = 0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic 
      correlations were observed between three nondiagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking 
      initiation, current smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge eating 
      (r(gs) = -0.19 to -0.23; qs < 0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was 
      no longer significant after co-varying for major depressive disorder loci. The 
      patterns of association between eating disorder- and substance-use-related 
      phenotypes highlights the potentially complex and substance-specific relationships 
      among these behaviors.

TI  - GWAS of lifetime cannabis use reveals new risk loci, genetic overlap with 
      psychiatric traits, and a causal influence of schizophrenia.
PG  - 1161-1170

AB  - Cannabis use is a heritable trait that has been associated with adverse mental 
      health outcomes. In the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for lifetime 
      cannabis use to date (N = 184,765), we identified eight genome-wide significant 
      independent single nucleotide polymorphisms in six regions. All measured genetic 
      variants combined explained 11% of the variance. Gene-based tests revealed 35 
      significant genes in 16 regions, and S-PrediXcan analyses showed that 21 genes had 
      different expression levels for cannabis users versus nonusers. The strongest 
      finding across the different analyses was CADM2, which has been associated with 
      substance use and risk-taking. Significant genetic correlations were found with 14 
      of 25 tested substance use and mental health-related traits, including smoking, 
      alcohol use, schizophrenia and risk-taking. Mendelian randomization analysis showed 
      evidence for a causal positive influence of schizophrenia risk on cannabis use. 
      Overall, our study provides new insights into the etiology of cannabis use and its 
      relation with mental health.

TI  - Cannabis sativa (Hemp) Seeds, Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol, and Potential Overdose.
PG  - 274-281
LID - 10.1089/can.2017.0040 [doi]
AB  - Introduction:Cannabis sativa (hemp) seeds are popular for their high nutrient 
      content, and strict regulations are in place to limit the amount of potentially 
      harmful phytocannabinoids, especially Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC). In 
      Canada, this limit is 10 μg of Δ(9)-THC per gram of hemp seeds (10 ppm), and other 
      jurisdictions in the world follow similar guidelines. Materials and Methods: We 
      investigated three different brands of consumer-grade hemp seeds using four 
      different procedures to extract phytocannabinoids, and quantified total Δ(9)-THC and 
      cannabidiol (CBD). Discussion: We discovered that Δ(9)-THC concentrations in these 
      hemp seeds could be as high as 1250% of the legal limit, and the amount of 
      phytocannabinoids depended on the extraction procedure employed, Soxhlet extraction 
      being the most efficient across all three brands of seeds. Δ(9)-THC and CBD 
      exhibited significant variations in their estimated concentrations even from the 
      same brand, reflecting the inhomogeneous nature of seeds and variability due to the 
      extraction method, but almost in all cases, Δ(9)-THC concentrations were higher than 
      the legal limit. These quantities of total Δ(9)-THC may reach as high as 3.8 mg per 
      gram of hemp seeds, if one were consuming a 30-g daily recommended amount of hemp 
      seeds, and is a cause for concern for potential toxicity. It is not clear if these 
      high quantities of Δ(9)-THC are due to contamination of the seeds, or any other 
      reason. Conclusion: Careful consideration of the extraction method is very important 
      for the measurement of cannabinoids in hemp seeds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A trend has recently emerged of individuals using electronic nicotine 
      delivery systems (ENDS) or similar devices to vaporize cannabis, either in the form 
      of high-potency THC concentrates or cannabis plant material. Peer use is central to 
      the adoption of substance use behaviors in young adulthood, but little is known 
      about peer influence for initiating cannabis vaping. METHODS: A longitudinal 
      investigation of first-year college students (N = 1313) using social network methods 
      was conducted to determine the prevalence of vaping cannabis, differences in 
      networks between individuals who initiate vaping cannabis, and predictors of 
      initiation of vaping cannabis across two time points. The surveys were available for 
      two weeks beginning in the sixth week of each semester. RESULTS: We found that 9.4% 
      vaped in their lifetime but not since the first survey, 7.5% vaped in their lifetime 
      and since the first survey, and 5.9% reported vaping cannabis at the second survey. 
      Lifetime cannabis use, lifetime ENDS use, and number of peers who initiated vaping 
      cannabis from Time 1 to Time 2 were significantly associated with increased odds of 
      the initiation of vaping cannabis; the number of any-cannabis-using or 
      any-ENDS-using peers was not associated with increased odds of initiating vaping 
      cannabis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with the greatest risk of initiation of vaping 
      cannabis during the first year of college are those with a prior history of other 
      cannabis use and ENDS use and who have peers in their network who initiate cannabis 
      vaping.

TI  - Perioperative pain and addiction interdisciplinary network (PAIN): protocol for the 
      perioperative management of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines using a 
      modified Delphi process.
PG  - e036472

AB  - INTRODUCTION: At the conception of this study (January 2019), a literature search by 
      the authors found no evidence-based or consensus perioperative guidelines for 
      patients consuming cannabis products, or for those patients in whom a cannabinoid 
      medication could be considered for perioperative treatment. Currently, there is a 
      large global population that consumes cannabis. The availability of cannabis has 
      also increased this decade with greater legal access to cannabis products in some 
      countries such as USA, Canada, Uruguay, Israel, Australia and Germany. There are 
      recognised possible therapeutic benefits for the use of cannabis in patients with 
      chronic pain, chronic neuropathic pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 
      There are also potential side effects from cannabis use such as psychosis, cannabis 
      hyperemesis syndrome, misuse disorder and cannabis withdrawal syndrome. There is 
      evidence that cannabis may also affect factors in the perioperative period such as 
      monitoring, quality of analgesia, sleep and opioid consumption. Given the large 
      population of persons using cannabis, the heterogeneity of cannabis products and the 
      paucity (and heterogeneity) of perioperative literature surrounding it, 
      perioperative guidelines for cannabis consuming patients are both lacking and 
      necessary. In this paper, we present the design for a modified Delphi technique that 
      has been started with the intent of deriving cannabis perioperative guidelines from 
      the available medical literature and the consensus of multidisciplinary experts. 
      MATERIALS, METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will use a scoping narrative literature 
      review and modified Delphi process to generate cannabis perioperative guidelines. A 
      scoping narrative review of cannabis in the perioperative period by the authors of 
      this proposal was completed and provided to a panel of 17 experts. These experts 
      were recruited for their knowledge and expertise regarding cannabis and/or 
      perioperative medicine. They were asked to rate a series of indications and clinical 
      scenarios in two rounds. During the first round, the expert panel was blinded to 
      each other's participation. During the second round of this process, the expert 
      panel met after being provided with an analysis of the first round's submissions so 
      they could be discussed further and, if possible, reach a further consensus 
      regarding them. Using the results obtained from the Delphi review process, a draft 
      of proposed cannabis perioperative guidelines will be generated. These proposed 
      guidelines will be returned to the expert panel for critiquing prior to their 
      finalisation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Study and panellist data will be 
      deidentified and stored as per institutional (Toronto General Hospital) guidelines. 
      Institutional research ethics board provided a waiver for this modified Delphi 
      protocol. Findings will be presented and published in peer-reviewed publications and 
      conferences.

TI  - Depressive symptoms and cannabis use in a placebo-controlled trial of 
      N-Acetylcysteine for adult cannabis use disorder.
PG  - 479-490
LID - 10.1007/s00213-019-05384-z [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Depression is common among individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD), 
      particularly individuals who present to CUD treatment. Treatments that consider this 
      comorbidity are essential. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this secondary analysis was to 
      examine whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced depressive symptoms among adults (age 
      18-50) with CUD (N = 302) and whether the effect of NAC on cannabis cessation varied 
      as a result of baseline levels of depression. Bidirectional associations between 
      cannabis use amount and depression were also examined. METHODS: Data for this 
      secondary analysis were from a National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network 
      (NIDA CTN) multi-site clinical trial for CUD. Adults with CUD (N = 302) were 
      randomized to receive 2400 mg of NAC daily or matched placebo for 12 weeks. All 
      participants received abstinence-based contingency management. Cannabis quantity was 
      measured by self-report, and weekly urinary cannabinoid levels 
      (11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) confirmed abstinence. Depressive symptoms 
      were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Depressive 
      symptoms did not differ between the NAC and placebo groups during treatment. There 
      was no significant interaction between treatment and baseline depression predicting 
      cannabis abstinence during treatment. Higher baseline depression was associated with 
      decreased abstinence throughout treatment and a significant gender interaction 
      suggested that this may be particularly true for females. Cross-lagged panel models 
      suggested that depressive symptoms preceded increased cannabis use amounts (in 
      grams) during the subsequent month. The reverse pathway was not significant (i.e., 
      greater cannabis use preceding depressive symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this 
      study suggest that depression may be a risk factor for poor CUD treatment outcome 
      and therefore should be addressed in the context of treatment. However, results do 
      not support the use of NAC to concurrently treat co-occurring depressive symptoms 
      and CUD in adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01675661.

AB  - PURPOSE: Alcohol and cannabis are the most commonly used substances during 
      adolescence and are typically initiated during this sensitive neurodevelopmental 
      period. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the most 
      recent literature focused on understanding how these substances affect the 
      developing brain. SEARCH METHODS: Articles included in this review were identified 
      by entering 30 search terms focused on substance use, adolescence, and 
      neurodevelopment into MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central, and Web of 
      Science. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they longitudinally examined the 
      effect of adolescent alcohol and/or cannabis use on structural or functional 
      outcomes in 50 or more participants. SEARCH RESULTS: More than 700 articles were 
      captured by the search, and 43 longitudinal studies met inclusion criteria, 
      including 18 studies focused on alcohol use, 13 on cannabis use, and 12 on alcohol 
      and cannabis co-use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Existing studies suggest heavy 
      alcohol and cannabis use during adolescence are related to small to moderate 
      disruptions in brain structure and function, as well as neurocognitive impairment. 
      The effects of alcohol use include widespread decreases in gray matter volume and 
      cortical thickness across time; slowed white matter growth and poorer integrity; 
      disrupted network efficiency; and poorer impulse and attentional control, learning, 
      memory, visuospatial processing, and psychomotor speed. The severity of some effects 
      is dependent on dose. Heavy to very heavy cannabis use is associated with decreased 
      subcortical volume and increased frontoparietal cortical thickness, disrupted 
      functional development, and decreased executive functioning and IQ compared to 
      non-using controls. Overall, co-use findings suggest more pronounced effects related 
      to alcohol use than to cannabis use. Several limitations exist in the literature. 
      Sample sizes are relatively small and demographically homogenous, with significant 
      heterogeneity in substance use patterns and methodologies across studies. More 
      research is needed to clarify how substance dosing and interactions between 
      substances, as well as sociodemographic and environmental factors, affect outcomes. 
      Larger longitudinal studies, already underway, will help clarify the relationship 
      between brain development and substance use.

AB  - Given the aging Baby Boomer generation, changes in cannabis legislation, and the 
      growing acknowledgment of cannabis for its therapeutic potential, it is predicted 
      that cannabis use in the older population will escalate. It is, therefore, important 
      to determine the interaction between the effects of cannabis and aging. The aim of 
      this report is to describe the link between cannabis use and the aging brain. Our 
      review of the literature found few and inconsistent empirical studies that directly 
      address the impact of cannabis use on the aging brain. However, research focused on 
      long-term cannabis use points toward cumulative effects on multimodal systems in the 
      brain that are similarly affected during aging. Specifically, the effects of 
      cannabis and aging converge on overlapping networks in the endocannabinoid, opioid, 
      and dopamine systems that may affect functional decline particularly in the 
      hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which are critical areas for memory and executive 
      functioning. To conclude, despite the limited current knowledge on the potential 
      interactive effects between cannabis and aging, evidence from the literature 
      suggests that cannabis and aging effects are concurrently present across several 
      neurotransmitter systems. There is a great need for future research to directly test 
      the interactions between cannabis and aging.

TI  - Effect of baseline cannabis use and working-memory network function on changes in 
      cannabis use in heavy cannabis users: a prospective fMRI study.
PG  - 2470-82
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22342 [doi]
AB  - Theoretical models of addiction suggest that a substance use disorder represents an 
      imbalance between hypersensitive motivational processes and deficient regulatory 
      executive functions. Working-memory (a central executive function) may be a powerful 
      predictor of the course of drug use and drug-related problems. Goal of the current 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to assess the predictive power of 
      working-memory network function for future cannabis use and cannabis-related problem 
      severity in heavy cannabis users. Tensor independent component analysis was used to 
      investigate differences in working-memory network function between 32 heavy cannabis 
      users and 41 nonusing controls during an N-back working-memory task. In addition, 
      associations were examined between working-memory network function and cannabis use 
      and problem severity at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Behavioral performance 
      and working-memory network function did not significantly differ between heavy 
      cannabis users and controls. However, among heavy cannabis users, individual 
      differences in working-memory network response had an independent effect on change 
      in weekly cannabis use 6 months later (ΔR(2) = 0.11, P = 0.006, f(2) = 0.37) beyond 
      baseline cannabis use (ΔR(2) = 0.41) and a behavioral measure of approach bias 
      (ΔR(2) = 0.18): a stronger network response during the N-back task was related to an 
      increase in weekly cannabis use. These findings imply that heavy cannabis users 
      requiring greater effort to accurately complete an N-back working-memory task have a 
      higher probability of escalating cannabis use. Working-memory network function may 
      be a biomarker for the prediction of course and treatment outcome in cannabis users.

AB  - In recent years high-THC (psychoactive) and low-THC (industrial hemp) type cannabis 
      (Cannabis sativa L.) have gained immense attention in medical, food, and a plethora 
      of other consumer product markets. Among the planting materials used for 
      cultivation, tissue culture clones provide various advantages such as economies of 
      scale, production of disease-free and true-to-type plants for reducing the risk of 
      GMP-EuGMP level medical cannabis production, as well as the development and 
      application of various technologies for genetic improvement. Various tissue culture 
      methods have the potential application with cannabis for research, breeding, and 
      novel trait development, as well as commercial mass propagation. Although tissue 
      culture techniques for plant regeneration and micropropagation have been reported 
      for different cannabis genotypes and explant sources, there are significant 
      variations in the response of cultures and the morphogenic pathway. Methods for many 
      high-yielding elite strains are still rudimentary, and protocols are not 
      established. With a recent focus on sequencing and genomics in cannabis, genetic 
      transformation systems are applied to medical cannabis and hemp for functional gene 
      annotation via traditional and transient transformation methods to create novel 
      phenotypes by gene expression modulation and to validate gene function. This review 
      presents the current status of research focusing on different aspects of tissue 
      culture, including micropropagation, transformation, and the regeneration of 
      medicinal cannabis and industrial hemp transformants. Potential future tissue 
      culture research strategies helping elite cannabis breeding and propagation are also 
      presented.

AB  - In many countries, liberalisation of the legislation regulating the use of cannabis 
      has outpaced rigorous scientific studies, and a growing number of patients 
      presenting for surgery consume cannabis regularly. Research to date suggests that 
      cannabis can impact perioperative outcomes. We present recommendations obtained 
      using a modified Delphi method for the perioperative care of cannabis-using 
      patients. A steering committee was formed and a review of medical literature with 
      respect to perioperative cannabis use was conducted. This was followed by the 
      recruitment of a panel of 17 experts on the care of cannabis-consuming patients. 
      Panellists were blinded to each other's participation and were provided with rater 
      forms exploring the appropriateness of specific perioperative care elements. The 
      completed rater forms were analysed for consensus. The expert panel was then 
      unblinded and met to discuss the rater form analyses. Draft recommendations were 
      then created and returned to the expert panel for further comment. The draft 
      recommendations were also sent to four independent reviewers (a surgeon, a nurse 
      practitioner, and two patients). The collected feedback was used to finalise the 
      recommendations. The major recommendations obtained included emphasising the 
      importance of eliciting a history of cannabis use, quantifying it, and ensuring 
      contact with a cannabis authoriser (if one exists). Recommendations also included 
      the consideration of perioperative cannabis weaning, additional postoperative nausea 
      and vomiting prophylaxis, and additional attention to monitoring and maintaining 
      anaesthetic depth. Postoperative recommendations included anticipating increased 
      postoperative analgesic requirements and maintaining vigilance for cannabis 
      withdrawal syndrome.

TI  - Consensus-based recommendations for titrating cannabinoids and tapering opioids for 
      chronic pain control.

AB  - AIMS: Opioid misuse and overuse have contributed to a widespread overdose crisis and 
      many patients and physicians are considering medical cannabis to support opioid 
      tapering and chronic pain control. Using a five-step modified Delphi process, we 
      aimed to develop consensus-based recommendations on: 1) when and how to safely 
      initiate and titrate cannabinoids in the presence of opioids, 2) when and how to 
      safely taper opioids in the presence of cannabinoids and 3) how to monitor patients 
      and evaluate outcomes when treating with opioids and cannabinoids. RESULTS: In 
      patients with chronic pain taking opioids not reaching treatment goals, there was 
      consensus that cannabinoids may be considered for patients experiencing or 
      displaying opioid-related complications, despite psychological or physical 
      interventions. There was consensus observed to initiate with a cannabidiol 
      (CBD)-predominant oral extract in the daytime and consider adding 
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). When adding THC, start with 0.5-3 mg, and increase by 
      1-2 mg once or twice weekly up to 30-40 mg/day. Initiate opioid tapering when the 
      patient reports a minor/major improvement in function, seeks less as-needed 
      medication to control pain and/or the cannabis dose has been optimised. The opioid 
      tapering schedule may be 5%-10% of the morphine equivalent dose (MED) every 1 to 
      4 weeks. Clinical success could be defined by an improvement in function/quality of 
      life, a ≥30% reduction in pain intensity, a ≥25% reduction in opioid dose, a 
      reduction in opioid dose to <90 mg MED and/or reduction in opioid-related adverse 
      events. CONCLUSIONS: This five-stage modified Delphi process led to the development 
      of consensus-based recommendations surrounding the safe introduction and titration 
      of cannabinoids in concert with tapering opioids.

AB  - The impaired response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) model proposes 
      that impaired response inhibition and salience attribution underlie drug seeking and 
      taking. To update this model, we systematically reviewed 105 task-related 
      neuroimaging studies (n > 15/group) published since 2010. Results demonstrate 
      specific impairments within six large-scale brain networks (reward, habit, salience, 
      executive, memory, and self-directed networks) during drug cue exposure, decision 
      making, inhibitory control, and social-emotional processing. Addicted individuals 
      demonstrated increased recruitment of these networks during drug-related processing 
      but a blunted response during non-drug-related processing, with the same networks 
      also being implicated during resting state. Associations with real-life drug use, 
      relapse, therapeutic interventions, and the relevance to initiation of drug use 
      during adolescence support the clinical relevance of the results. Whereas the 
      salience and executive networks showed impairments throughout the addiction cycle, 
      the reward network was dysregulated at later stages of abuse. Effects were similar 
      in alcohol, cannabis, and stimulant addiction.

TI  - Peer Network Counseling as Brief Treatment for Urban Adolescent Heavy Cannabis 
      Users.
PG  - 152-157
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A small body of evidence supports targeting adolescents who are heavy 
      users of cannabis with brief interventions, yet more research is needed to confirm 
      the effectiveness of these studies. We conducted a secondary analysis of our Peer 
      Network Counseling (PNC) study (Mason et al., 2015), focusing on 46 adolescents of 
      the sample of 119 who reported heavy cannabis use at baseline. METHOD: Urban 
      adolescents (91% African American) presenting for primary health care were 
      randomized to intervention or control conditions and followed for 6 months. We 
      selected cases (n = 46) to analyze based on heavy cannabis use reported at baseline 
      (≥10 times in past month). The ordinal response data (cannabis use) were modeled 
      using a mixed-effects proportional odds model, including fixed effects for 
      treatment, time, and their interaction, and a subject-level random effect. RESULTS: 
      In the subsample of adolescents with heavy cannabis use, those assigned to PNC had a 
      35.9% probability of being abstinent at 6 months, compared with a 13.2% probability 
      in the control condition. Adolescents in the PNC condition had a 16.6% probability 
      of using cannabis 10 or more times per month, compared with a 38.1% probability in 
      the control condition. This differs from results of the full sample (N = 119), where 
      no significant effects on cannabis use were found. CONCLUSIONS: PNC increased the 
      probability of abstinence and reduced heavy cannabis use. These results provide 
      initial support for PNC as a model for brief treatment with non-treatment seeking 
      adolescents who are heavy users of cannabis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergent studies show that similar to other substances of abuse, 
      cue-reactivity to cannabis is also associated with neural response in the brain's 
      reward pathway (Filbey et al., 2009). However, the inter-relatedness of brain 
      regions during cue-reactivity in cannabis users remains unknown. METHODS: In this 
      study, we conducted a series of investigations to determine functional connectivity 
      during cue-reactivity in 71 cannabis users. First, we used psychophysiological 
      interaction (PPI) analysis to examine coherent neural response to cannabis cues. 
      Second, we evaluated whether these patterns of network functional connectivity 
      differentiated dependent and non-dependent users. Finally, as an exploratory 
      analysis, we determined the directionality of these connections via Granger 
      connectivity analyses. RESULTS: PPI analyses showed reward network functional 
      connectivity with the nucleus accumbens (NAc) seed region during cue exposure. 
      Between-group contrasts found differential effects of dependence status. Dependent 
      users (N=31) had greater functional connectivity with amygdala and anterior 
      cingulate gyrus (ACG) seeds while the non-dependent users (N=24) had greater 
      functional connectivity with the NAc, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus 
      seeds. Granger analyses showed that hippocampal and ACG activation preceded neural 
      response in reward areas. CONCLUSIONS: Both PPI and Granger analyses demonstrated 
      strong functional coherence in reward regions during exposure to cannabis cues in 
      current cannabis users. Functional connectivity (but not regional activation) in the 
      reward network differentiated dependent from non-dependent cannabis users. Our 
      findings suggest that repeated cannabis exposure causes observable changes in 
      functional connectivity in the reward network and should be considered in 
      intervention strategies.

TI  - The Impact of Perioperative Cannabis Use: A Narrative Scoping Review.
PG  - 219-230
LID - 10.1089/can.2019.0054 [doi]
AB  - As countries progressively embrace the legalization of both medicinal and 
      recreational cannabis, there remains a significant knowledge gap when it comes to 
      the perioperative uses of cannabis, as well as the management of cannabis users. 
      This review summarizes the information available on the subject based on existing 
      published studies. Articles outlining the physiological changes occurring in the 
      human body during acute and chronic use of cannabis (outside the context of 
      anesthesia) are also taken into consideration as understanding these changes allows 
      a more calculated approach to better anticipate patients' needs in the perioperative 
      setting. Common questions facing the anesthesiologist at each phase of the 
      perioperative period will be addressed and a systematic approach to the effect of 
      cannabinoids on various organ systems will also be presented. Issues unique to 
      cannabis use such as cannabis withdrawal syndrome and alterations in post-operative 
      pain processing will also be discussed. To date, the number of studies available for 
      guidance is small and study designs are markedly heterogenous, if not limited, 
      making conclusions challenging. While the currently available information can assist 
      in making decisions, further studies of larger scale are eagerly anticipated to help 
      guide future patient care.

AB  - Due to the myriad of laws concerning cannabis, there is little empirical research 
      regarding the veterinary use of cannabidiol (CBD). This study used the Veterinary 
      Information Network (VIN) to gauge US veterinarians' knowledge level, views and 
      experiences related to the use of cannabinoids in the medical treatment of dogs. 
      Participants (n = 2130) completed an anonymous, online survey. Results were analyzed 
      based on legal status of recreational marijuana in the participants' state of 
      practice, and year of graduation from veterinary school. Participants felt 
      comfortable in their knowledge of the differences between Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
      (THC) and marijuana, as well as the toxic effects of marijuana in dogs. Most 
      veterinarians (61.5%) felt comfortable discussing the use of CBD with their 
      colleagues, but only 45.5% felt comfortable discussing this topic with clients. No 
      differences were found based on state of practice, but recent graduates were less 
      comfortable discussing the topic. Veterinarians and clients in states with legalized 
      recreational marijuana were more likely to talk about the use of CBD products to 
      treat canine ailments than those in other states. Overall, CBD was most frequently 
      discussed as a potential treatment for pain management, anxiety and seizures. 
      Veterinarians practicing in states with legalized recreational marijuana were more 
      likely to advise their clients and recommend the use of CBD, while there was no 
      difference in the likelihood of prescribing CBD products. Recent veterinary 
      graduates were less likely to recommend or prescribe CBD. The most commonly used CBD 
      formulations were oil/extract and edibles. These were most helpful in providing 
      analgesia for chronic and acute pain, relieving anxiety and decreasing seizure 
      frequency/severity. The most commonly reported side-effect was sedation. 
      Participants felt their state veterinary associations and veterinary boards did not 
      provide sufficient guidance for them to practice within applicable laws. Recent 
      graduates and those practicing in states with legalized recreational marijuana were 
      more likely to agree that research regarding the use of CBD in dogs is needed. These 
      same groups also felt that marijuana and CBD should not remain classified as 
      Schedule I drugs. Most participants agreed that both marijuana and CBD products 
      offer benefits for humans and expressed support for use of CBD products for animals.

TI  - Cannabis, cigarettes, and their co-occurring use: Disentangling differences in 
      default mode network functional connectivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resting-state functional connectivity is a noninvasive, neuroimaging 
      method for assessing neural network function. Altered functional connectivity among 
      regions of the default-mode network have been associated with both nicotine and 
      cannabis use; however, less is known about co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use. 
      METHODS: We used posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed-based resting-state 
      functional connectivity analyses to examine default mode network (DMN) connectivity 
      strength differences between four groups: (1) individuals diagnosed with cannabis 
      dependence who do not smoke tobacco (n=19; ages 20-50), (2) cannabis-dependent 
      individuals who smoke tobacco (n=23, ages 21-52), (3) cannabis-naïve, 
      nicotine-dependent individuals who smoke tobacco (n=24, ages 21-57), and (4) 
      cannabis- and tobacco-naïve healthy controls (n=21, ages 21-50), controlling for 
      age, sex, and alcohol use. We also explored associations between connectivity 
      strength and measures of cannabis and tobacco use. RESULTS: PCC seed-based analyses 
      identified the core nodes of the DMN (i.e., PCC, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior 
      parietal cortex, and temporal cortex). In general, the cannabis-dependent, 
      nicotine-dependent, and co-occurring use groups showed lower DMN connectivity 
      strengths than controls, with unique group differences in connectivity strength 
      between the PCC and the cerebellum, medial prefrontal cortex, parahippocampus, and 
      anterior insula. In cannabis-dependent individuals, PCC-right anterior insula 
      connectivity strength correlated with duration of cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study extends previous research that independently examined the differences in 
      resting-state functional connectivity among individuals who smoke cannabis and 
      tobacco by including an examination of co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use and 
      provides further evidence that cannabis and tobacco exposure is associated with 
      alterations in DMN connectivity.

AB  - In September 2015, the member states of the United Nations endorsed sustainable 
      development goals (SDG) for 2030 that aspire to human rights-centered approaches to 
      ensuring the health and well-being of all people. The SDGs embody both the UN 
      Charter values of rights and justice for all and the responsibility of states to 
      rely on the best scientific evidence as they seek to better humankind. In April 
      2016, these same states will consider control of illicit drugs, an area of social 
      policy that has been fraught with controversy, seen as inconsistent with human 
      rights norms, and for which scientific evidence and public health approaches have 
      arguably played too limited a role. The previous UN General Assembly Special Session 
      (UNGASS) on drugs in 1998 – convened under the theme “a drug-free world, we can do 
      it!” – endorsed drug control policies based on the goal of prohibiting all use, 
      possession, production, and trafficking of illicit drugs. This goal is enshrined in 
      national law in many countries. In pronouncing drugs a “grave threat to the health 
      and well-being of all mankind,” the 1998 UNGASS echoed the foundational 1961 
      convention of the international drug control regime, which justified eliminating the 
      “evil” of drugs in the name of “the health and welfare of mankind.” But neither of 
      these international agreements refers to the ways in which pursuing drug prohibition 
      itself might affect public health. The “war on drugs” and “zero-tolerance” policies 
      that grew out of the prohibitionist consensus are now being challenged on multiple 
      fronts, including their health, human rights, and development impact. The Johns 
      Hopkins – Lancet Commission on Drug Policy and Health has sought to examine the 
      emerging scientific evidence on public health issues arising from drug control 
      policy and to inform and encourage a central focus on public health evidence and 
      outcomes in drug policy debates, such as the important deliberations of the 2016 
      UNGASS on drugs. The Johns Hopkins-Lancet Commission is concerned that drug policies 
      are often colored by ideas about drug use and drug dependence that are not 
      scientifically grounded. The 1998 UNGASS declaration, for example, like the UN drug 
      conventions and many national drug laws, does not distinguish between drug use and 
      drug abuse. A 2015 report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, by contrast, 
      found it important to emphasize that “[d]rug use is neither a medical condition nor 
      does it necessarily lead to drug dependence.” The idea that all drug use is 
      dangerous and evil has led to enforcement-heavy policies and has made it difficult 
      to see potentially dangerous drugs in the same light as potentially dangerous foods, 
      tobacco, alcohol for which the goal of social policy is to reduce potential harms. 
      HEALTH IMPACT OF DRUG POLICY BASED ON ENFORCEMENT OF PROHIBITION: The pursuit of 
      drug prohibition has generated a parallel economy run by criminal networks. Both 
      these networks, which resort to violence to protect their markets, and the police 
      and sometimes military or paramilitary forces that pursue them contribute to 
      violence and insecurity in communities affected by drug transit and sales. In 
      Mexico, the dramatic increase in homicides since the government decided to use 
      military forces against drug traffickers in 2006 has been so great that it reduced 
      life expectancy in the country. Injection of drugs with contaminated equipment is a 
      well-known route of HIV exposure and viral hepatitis transmission. People who inject 
      drugs (PWID) are also at high risk of tuberculosis. The continued spread of unsafe 
      injection-linked HIV contrasts the progress that has been seen in reducing sexual 
      and vertical transmission of HIV in the last three decades. The Commission found 
      that that repressive drug policing greatly contributes to the risk of HIV linked to 
      injection. Policing may be a direct barrier to services such as needle and syringe 
      programmes (NSP) and use of non-injected opioids to treat dependence among those who 
      inject opioids, known as opioid substitution therapy (OST). Police seeking to boost 
      arrest totals have been found to target facilities that provide these services to 
      find, harass, and detain large numbers of people who use drugs. Drug paraphernalia 
      laws that prohibit possession of injecting equipment lead PWID to fear carrying 
      syringes and force them to share equipment or dispose of it unsafely. Policing 
      practices undertaken in the name of the public good have demonstrably worsened 
      public health outcomes. Amongst the most significant impacts of pursuit of drug 
      prohibition identified by the Commission with respect to infectious disease is the 
      excessive use of incarceration as a drug-control measure. Many national laws impose 
      lengthy custodial sentences for minor, non-violent drug offenses; people who use 
      drugs (PWUD) are over-represented in prison and pretrial detention. Drug use and 
      drug injection occur in prisons, though their occurrence is often denied by 
      officials. HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission occurs among prisoners and 
      detainees, often complicated by co-infection with TB and in many places 
      multidrug-resistant TB, and too few states offer prevention or treatment services in 
      spite of international guidelines that urge comprehensive measures, including 
      provision of injection equipment, for people in state custody. Mathematical 
      modelling undertaken by the Commission illustrates that incarceration and high HCV 
      risk in the post-incarceration period can contribute importantly to national HCV 
      incidence amongst PWID in a range of countries with varying levels of incarceration, 
      different average prison sentences, durations of injection, and OST coverage levels 
      in prison and following release. For example, in Thailand where PWID may spend 
      nearly half their injection careers in prison, an estimated 63% of incident HCV 
      infection could occur in prison. In Scotland, where prison sentences are shorter for 
      PWUD and OST coverage is relatively high in prison, an estimated 54% of incident HCV 
      infection occurs in prison, but as much as 21% may occur in the high-risk 
      post-release period. These results underscore the importance of alternatives to 
      prison for minor drug offences, ensuring access to OST in prison, and a seamless 
      link from prison services to OST in the community. The evidence also clearly 
      demonstrates that drug law enforcement has been applied in a discriminatory way 
      against racial and ethnic minorities in a number of countries. The US is perhaps the 
      best documented but not the only case of racial biases in policing, arrest, and 
      sentencing. In 2014, African American men were more than five times more likely than 
      whites to be incarcerated in their lifetime, though there is no significant 
      difference in rates of drug use among these populations. The impact of this bias on 
      communities of people of color is inter-generational and socially and economically 
      devastating. The Commission also found significant gender biases in current drug 
      policies. Of women in prison and pretrial detention around the world, a higher 
      percentage are detained because of drug infractions than is the case for men. Women 
      involved in drug markets are often on the bottom rungs – as couriers or drivers – 
      and may not have information about major traffickers to trade as leverage with 
      prosecutors. Gender and racial biases have marked overlap, making this an 
      intersectional threat to women of color, their children, families, and communities. 
      In both prison and the community, HIV, HCV and TB programmes for PWUD – including 
      testing, prevention and treatment – are gravely underfunded at the cost of 
      preventable death and disease. In a number of middle-income countries where large 
      numbers of PWUD live, HIV and TB programmes for PWUD that were expanded with support 
      from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria have lost funding due to changes 
      in the Fund’s eligibility criteria. There is an unfortunate failure to emulate the 
      example of Western European countries that have eliminated unsafe injection-linked 
      HIV as a public health problem by sustainably scaling up prevention and care and 
      enabling minor offenders to avert prison. Political resistance to harm reduction 
      measures dismisses strong evidence of their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. 
      Mathematical modeling shows that if OST, NSP and antiretroviral therapy for HIV are 
      all available, even if the coverage of each of them is not over 50%, their synergy 
      can lead to effective prevention in a foreseeable future. PWUD are often not seen to 
      be worthy of costly treatments, or they are thought not to be able to adhere to 
      treatment regimens in spite of evidence to the contrary. Lethal drug overdose is an 
      important public health problem, particularly in light of rising consumption of 
      heroin and prescription opioids in some parts of the world. Yet the Commission found 
      that the pursuit of drug prohibition can contribute to overdose risks in numerous 
      ways. It creates unregulated illegal markets in which it is impossible to control 
      adulterants of street drugs that add to overdose risk. Several studies also link 
      aggressive policing to rushed injection and overdose risk. People with a history of 
      drug use, over-represented in prison because of prohibitionist policies, are at 
      extremely high risk of overdose when released from state custody. Lack of ready 
      access to OST also contributes to injection of opioids, and bans on supervised 
      injection sites cut off an intervention that has proven very effective in reducing 
      overdose deaths. Restrictive drug policies also contribute to unnecessary controls 
      on naloxone, a medicine that can reverse overdose very effectively. Though a small 
      percentage of PWUD will ever need treatment for drug dependence, that minority faces 
      enormous barriers to humane and affordable treatment in many countries. There are 
      often no national standards for quality of drug dependence treatment and no regular 
      monitoring of practices. In too many countries, beatings, forced labor, and denial 
      of health care and adequate sanitation are offered in the name of treatment, 
      including in compulsory detention centres that are more like prisons than treatment 
      facilities. Where there are humane treatment options, it is often the case that 
      those most in need of it cannot afford it. In many countries, there is no treatment 
      designed particularly for women, though it is known that women’s motivations for and 
      physiological reactions to drug use differ from those of men. The pursuit of the 
      elimination of drugs has led to aggressive and harmful practices targeting people 
      who grow crops used in the manufacture of drugs, especially coca leaf, opium poppy, 
      and cannabis. Aerial spraying of coca fields in the Andes with the defoliant 
      glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl glycine) has been associated with respiratory and 
      dermatological disorders and with miscarriages. Forced displacement of poor rural 
      families who have no secure land tenure exacerbates their poverty and food 
      insecurity and in some cases forces them to move their cultivation to more marginal 
      land. Geographic isolation makes it difficult for state authorities to reach drug 
      crop cultivators in public health and education campaigns and it cuts cultivators 
      off from basic health services. Alternative development programmes meant to offer 
      other livelihood opportunities have poor records and have rarely been conceived, 
      implemented, or evaluated with respect to their impact on people’s health. Research 
      on drugs and drug policy has suffered from the lack of a diversified funding base 
      and assumptions about drug use and drug pathologies on the part of the dominant 
      funder, the US government. At a time when drug policy discussions are opening up 
      around the world, there is an urgent to bring the best of non-ideologically-driven 
      health science, social science and policy analysis to the study of drugs and the 
      potential for policy reform. POLICY ALTERNATIVES IN REAL LIFE: Concrete experiences 
      from many countries that have modified or rejected prohibitionist approaches in 
      their response to drugs can inform discussions of drug policy reform. A number of 
      countries, such as Portugal and the Czech Republic, decriminalised minor drug 
      offenses years ago, with significant savings of money, less incarceration, 
      significant public health benefits, and no significant increase in drug use. 
      Decriminalisation of minor offenses along with scaling up low-threshold HIV 
      prevention services enabled Portugal to control an explosive unsafe injection-linked 
      HIV epidemic and likely enabled the Czech Republic to prevent one from happening. 
      Where formal decriminalisation may not be an immediate possibility, scaling up 
      health services for PWUD can demonstrate the value to society of responding with 
      support rather than punishment to people who commit minor drug infractions. A 
      pioneering OST program in Tanzania is encouraging communities and officials to 
      consider non-criminal responses to heroin injection. In Switzerland and the city of 
      Vancouver, Canada, dramatic improvements in access to comprehensive harm reduction 
      services, including supervised injection sites and heroin-assisted treatment, 
      transformed the health picture for PWUD. Vancouver’s experience also illustrates the 
      importance of meaningful participation of PWUD in decision-making on policies and 
      programmes affecting their communities. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Policies 
      meant to prohibit or greatly suppress drugs present a paradox. They are portrayed 
      and defended vigorously by many policy-makers as necessary to preserve public health 
      and safety, and yet the evidence suggests they have contributed directly and 
      indirectly to lethal violence, communicable disease transmission, discrimination, 
      forced displacement, unnecessary physical pain, and the undermining of people’s 
      right to health. Some would argue that the threat of drugs to society may justify 
      some level of abrogation of human rights for protection of collective security, as 
      is also foreseen by human rights law in case of emergencies. International human 
      rights standards dictate that in such cases, societies still must choose the least 
      harmful way to address the emergency and that emergency measures must be 
      proportionate and designed specifically to meet transparently defined and realistic 
      goals. The pursuit of drug prohibition meets none of these criteria. Standard public 
      health and scientific approaches that should be part of policy-making on drugs have 
      been rejected in the pursuit of prohibition. The idea of reducing the harm of many 
      kinds of human behavior is central to public policy in the areas of traffic safety, 
      tobacco and alcohol regulation, food safety, safety in sports and recreation, and 
      many other areas of human life where the behavior in question is not prohibited. But 
      explicitly seeking to reduce drug-related harms through policy and programmes and to 
      balance prohibition with harm reduction is regularly resisted in drug control. The 
      persistence of unsafe injection-linked HIV and HCV transmission that could be 
      stopped with proven, cost-effective measures remains one of the great failures of 
      the global responses to these diseases. Drug policy that is dismissive of extensive 
      evidence of its own negative impact and of approaches that could improve health 
      outcomes is bad for all concerned. Countries have failed to recognise and correct 
      the health and human rights harms that pursuit of prohibition and drug suppression 
      have caused and in so doing neglect their legal responsibilities. They readily 
      incarcerate people for minor offenses but then neglect their duty to provide health 
      services in custodial settings. They recognize uncontrolled illegal markets as the 
      consequence of their policies, but they do little to protect people from toxic, 
      adulterated drugs that are inevitable in illegal markets or the violence of 
      organized criminals, often made worse by policing. They waste public resources on 
      policies that do not demonstrably impede the functioning of drug markets, and they 
      miss opportunities to invest public resources wisely in proven health services for 
      people often too frightened to seek services. To move toward the balanced policy 
      that UN member states have called for, we offer the following recommendations: 
      Decriminalisation: Decriminalise minor, non-violent drug offenses – use, possession, 
      and petty sale – and strengthen health and social-sector alternatives to criminal 
      sanctions. Reducing violence and discrimination in policing: Reduce the violence and 
      other harms of drug policing, including phasing out the use of military forces in 
      drug policing, better targeting of policing on the most violent armed criminals, 
      allowing possession of syringes, not targeting harm reduction services to boost 
      arrest totals, and eliminating racial and ethnic discrimination in policing. 
      Reducing harms: Ensure easy access for all who need them to harm reduction services 
      as a part of responding to drugs, recognizing the effectiveness and 
      cost-effectiveness of scaling up and sustaining these services. OST, NSP, supervised 
      injection sites, and access to naloxone – brought to a scale adequate to meet demand 
      – should all figure in health services and should include meaningful participation 
      of PWUD in planning and implementation. Harm reduction services are crucial in 
      prison and pretrial detention and should be scaled up in these settings. The 2016 
      UNGASS should do better than the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) in naming 
      harm reduction explicitly and endorsing its centrality to drug policy. Treatment and 
      care for PWUD: Prioritize PWUD in treatment for HIV, HCV, TB, and ensure that 
      services are adequate to ensure access for all who need care. Ensure availability of 
      humane and scientifically sound treatment for drug dependence, including scaled-up 
      OST in the community as well as in prisons, rejecting compulsory detention and abuse 
      in the name of treatment. Access to controlled medicines: Ensure access to 
      controlled medicines, establishing inter-sectoral national authorities to determine 
      levels of need and giving the World Health Organization (WHO) the resources to 
      assist the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) in using the best science to 
      determine the level of need for controlled medicines in all countries. 
      Gender-responsive policies: Reduce the negative impact of drug policy and law on 
      women and their families, especially minimizing custodial sentences for women who 
      commit non-violent offenses and developing appropriate health and social support, 
      including gender-appropriate treatment of drug dependence, for those who need it. 
      Crop production: Efforts to address drug crop production must take health into 
      account. Aerial spraying of toxic herbicides should be stopped, and alternative 
      development programmes should be part of integrated development strategies, 
      developed and implemented in meaningful consultation with the people affected. 
      Improve research: There is a need for a more diverse donor base to fund the best new 
      science on drug policy experiences in a non-ideological way that, among other 
      things, interrogates and moves beyond the excessive pathologising of drug use. UN 
      governance of drug control: UN governance of drug policy must be improved, including 
      by respecting WHO’s authority to determine the dangerousness of drugs. Countries 
      should be urged to include high-level health officials in their delegations to CND. 
      Improved representation of health officials in national delegations to CND would, in 
      turn, be a likely result of giving health authorities an important day-to-day role 
      in multi-sectoral national drug policy-making bodies. Better metrics: Health, 
      development, and human rights indicators should be included in metrics to judge 
      success of drug policy; WHO and UNDP should help formulate them. UNDP has already 
      suggested that indicators such as access to treatment, rate of overdose deaths, and 
      access to social welfare programmes for people who use drugs would be useful 
      indicators. All drug policies should also be monitored and evaluated as to their 
      impact on racial and ethnic minorities, women, children and young people, and people 
      living in poverty. Scientific approach to regulated markets: Move gradually toward 
      regulated drug markets and apply the scientific method to their evaluation. While 
      regulated legal drug markets are not politically possible in the short term in some 
      places, the harms of criminal markets and other consequences of prohibition 
      catalogued in this report are likely to lead more countries (and more US states) to 
      move gradually in that direction, a direction we endorse. As those decisions are 
      taken, we urge governments and researchers to apply the scientific method and ensure 
      independent, multidisciplinary and rigorous evaluation of regulated markets to draw 
      lessons and inform improvements in regulatory practices, and to continue evaluating 
      and improving. We urge health professionals in all countries to inform themselves 
      and join debates on drug policy at all levels. True to the stated goals of the 
      international drug control regime, it is possible to have drug policy that 
      contributes to the health and well-being of humankind, but not without bringing to 
      bear the evidence of the health sciences and the voices of health professionals.

TI  - The Role of Cannabinoids as Anticancer Agents in Pediatric Oncology.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13010157 [doi]
LID - 157
AB  - Cannabinoids are a group of chemicals that bind to receptors in the human body and, 
      in turn, modulate the endocannabinoid system (ECS). They can be endogenously 
      produced, synthetic, or derived from the plant Cannabis sativa L. Research over the 
      past several decades has shown that the ECS is a cellular communication network 
      essential to maintain multiple biological functions and the homeostasis of the body. 
      Indeed, cannabinoids have been shown to influence a wide variety of biological 
      effects, including memory, pain, reproduction, bone remodeling or immunity, to name 
      a few. Unsurprisingly, given these broad physiological effects, alterations of the 
      ECS have been found in different diseases, including cancer. In recent years, the 
      medical use of cannabis has been approved in different countries for a variety of 
      human conditions. However, the use of these compounds, specifically as anticancer 
      agents, remains controversial. Studies have shown that cannabinoids do have 
      anticancer activity in different tumor types such as breast cancer, melanoma, 
      lymphoma and adult brain cancer. Specifically, phytocannabinoids 
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to induce 
      apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of adult cancer cells, as well as modulate 
      angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite increasing evidence that cannabinoids elicit 
      antitumor effects in adult cancers, there is minimal data available on their effects 
      in children or in pediatric cancers despite public and clinical demand for 
      information. Here we describe a comprehensive and critical review of what is known 
      about the effects of cannabinoids on pediatric cancers, highlight current gaps in 
      knowledge and identify the critical issues that need addressing before considering 
      these promising but controversial drugs for use in pediatric oncology.

TI  - A systematic review of neuroimaging and acute cannabis exposure in age-of-risk for 
      psychosis.
PG  - 217

LID - 217
AB  - Acute exposure to cannabis has been associated with an array of cognitive 
      alterations, increased risk for neuropsychiatric illness, and other neuropsychiatric 
      sequelae including the emergence of acute psychotic symptoms. However, the brain 
      alterations associating cannabis use and these behavioral and clinical phenotypes 
      remains disputed. To this end, neuroimaging can be a powerful technique to 
      non-invasively study the impact of cannabis exposure on brain structure and function 
      in both humans and animal models. While chronic exposure studies provide insight 
      into how use may be related to long-term outcomes, acute exposure may reveal 
      interesting information regarding the immediate impact of use and abuse on brain 
      circuits. Understanding these alterations could reveal the connection with symptom 
      dimensions in neuropsychiatric disorders and, more specifically with psychosis. The 
      purpose of the present review is to: 1) provide an update on the findings of 
      pharmacological neuroimaging studies examining the effects of administered 
      cannabinoids and 2) focus the discussion on studies that examine the sensitive 
      window for the emergence of psychosis. Current literature indicates that cannabis 
      exposure has varied effects on the brain, with the principal compounds in cannabis 
      (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) altering activity across different 
      brain regions. Importantly, we also discovered critical gaps in the literature, 
      particularly regarding sex-dependent responses and long-term effects of chronic 
      exposure. Certain networks often characterized as dysregulated in psychosis, like 
      the default mode network and limbic system, were also impacted by THC exposure, 
      identifying areas of particular interest for future work investigating the potential 
      relationship between the two.

TI  - Comorbidity of Symptoms of Alcohol and Cannabis Use Disorders among a 
      Population-Based Sample of Simultaneous Users. Insight from a Network Perspective.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph15122893 [doi]
LID - 2893
AB  - Research into comorbidity of alcohol and cannabis use disorders has resulted in 
      inconsistent findings, especially among simultaneous users, who used alcohol and 
      cannabis together on a single occasion. This study investigated the association of 
      alcohol and cannabis use disorders among simultaneous users using a network 
      perspective, which considers direct relationships between symptoms. We used a subset 
      of simultaneous alcohol and cannabis users driven from the representative 
      population-based sample of young Swiss men cohort study on substance use risk 
      factors (C-SURF) (n = 1559 at baseline and n = 991 at follow-up). Self-reported 
      symptoms of alcohol and cannabis use disorders were collected. Network analyses 
      included network estimation, visualization, and community detection tests. Alcohol 
      and cannabis use symptoms were separated in two distinct clusters, with few paths 
      between them (eleven positive edges at baseline, three at follow-up). Withdrawal 
      symptoms were likely to connect the two disorders at baseline, but not at follow-up. 
      Alcohol and cannabis use disorders appeared as separate disorders among simultaneous 
      users. Our findings mitigated previous findings on the detrimental association 
      between alcohol and cannabis use. Future studies should incorporate network analyses 
      as a means to study comorbidity in other community and clinical samples to confirm 
      our preliminary findings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance in the United 
      States, and nearly 1 in 4 young adults are current cannabis users. Chronic cannabis 
      use is associated with changes in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 
      the default mode network (DMN) in adolescents and young adults; results are somewhat 
      inconsistent across studies, potentially due to methodological differences. The aims 
      of the present study were to examine potential differences in DMN RSFC between 
      cannabis users and controls, and to examine, as an exploratory analysis, if gender 
      moderated any findings. We further examined whether differences in RSFC related to 
      differences in performance on selected neuropsychological measures. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Seventy-seven 16-26-year-old participants underwent an MRI scan (including 
      resting state scan), neuropsychological battery, toxicology screening, and drug use 
      interview. Differences in DMN connectivity were examined between groups (cannabis 
      vs. control) and with an exploratory group by gender interaction, using a left 
      posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed-based analysis conducted in AFNI. RESULTS: 
      Cannabis users demonstrated weaker connectivity than controls between the left PCC 
      and various DMN nodes, and the right Rolandic operculum/Heschl's gyrus. Cannabis 
      users demonstrated stronger connectivity between the left PCC and the cerebellum and 
      left supramarginal gyrus. The group by gender interaction was not significantly 
      associated with connectivity differences. Stronger left PCC-cerebellum connectivity 
      was associated with poorer performance on cognitive measures in cannabis users. In 
      controls, intra-DMN connectivity was positively correlated with performance on a 
      speeded selective/sustained attention measure. DISCUSSION: Consistent with our 
      hypotheses and other studies, cannabis users demonstrated weaker connectivity 
      between the left PCC and DMN nodes. Chronic THC exposure may alter GABA and 
      glutamate concentrations, which may alter brain communication. Future studies should 
      be conducted with a larger sample size and examine gender differences and the 
      mechanism by which these differences may arise.

AB  - Numerous aspects of mammalian physiology exhibit cyclic daily patterns known as 
      circadian rhythms. However, studies in aged humans and animals indicate that these 
      physiological rhythms are not consistent throughout the life span. The simultaneous 
      development of disrupted circadian rhythms and age-related impairments suggests a 
      shared mechanism, which may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Recently, the 
      endocannabinoid system has emerged as a complex signaling network, which regulates 
      numerous aspects of circadian physiology relevant to the neurobiology of aging. 
      Agonists of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) have consistently been shown to decrease 
      neuronal activity, core body temperature, locomotion, and cognitive function. 
      Paradoxically, several lines of evidence now suggest that very low doses of 
      cannabinoids are beneficial in advanced age. One potential explanation for this 
      phenomenon is that these drugs exhibit hormesis-a biphasic dose-response wherein low 
      doses produce the opposite effects of higher doses. Therefore, it is important to 
      determine the dose-, age-, and time-dependent effects of these substances on the 
      regulation of circadian rhythms and other processes dysregulated in aging. This 
      review highlights 3 fields-biological aging, circadian rhythms, and endocannabinoid 
      signaling-to critically assess the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid 
      modulation in aged individuals. If the hormetic properties of exogenous cannabinoids 
      are confirmed, we conclude that precise administration of these compounds may 
      bidirectionally entrain central and peripheral circadian clocks and benefit multiple 
      aspects of aging physiology.

TI  - Cannabis, Cannabinoids, and the Endocannabinoid System-Is there Therapeutic 
      Potential for Inflammatory Bowel Disease?
PG  - 525-535
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjy185 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis sativa and its extracts have been used for centuries, both medicinally and 
      recreationally. There is accumulating evidence that exogenous cannabis and related 
      cannabinoids improve symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], such 
      as pain, loss of appetite, and diarrhoea. In vivo, exocannabinoids have been 
      demonstrated to improve colitis, mainly in chemical models. Exocannabinoids signal 
      through the endocannabinoid system, an increasingly understood network of endogenous 
      lipid ligands and their receptors, together with a number of synthetic and 
      degradative enzymes and the resulting products. Modulating the endocannabinoid 
      system using pharmacological receptor agonists, genetic knockout models, or 
      inhibition of degradative enzymes have largely shown improvements in colitis in 
      vivo. Despite these promising experimental results, this has not translated into 
      meaningful benefits for human IBD in the few clinical trials which have been 
      conducted to date, the largest study being limited by poor medication tolerance due 
      to the Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol component. This review article synthesises the 
      current literature surrounding the modulation of the endocannabinoid system and 
      administration of exocannabinoids in experimental and human IBD. Findings of 
      clinical surveys and studies of cannabis use in IBD are summarised. Discrepancies in 
      the literature are highlighted together with identifying novel areas of interest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis growing practices and particularly indoor cultivation 
      conditions have a great influence on the production of cannabinoids. 
      Plant-associated microbes may affect nutrient acquisition by the plant. However, 
      beneficial microbes influencing cannabinoid biosynthesis remain largely unexplored 
      and unexploited in cannabis production. OBJECTIVE: To summarize study outcomes on 
      bacterial and fungal communities associated with cannabis using high-throughput 
      sequencing technologies and to uncover microbial interactions, species diversity, 
      and microbial network connections that potentially influence secondary metabolite 
      production in cannabis. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A mini review was conducted including 
      recent publications on cannabis and their associated microbiota and secondary 
      metabolite production. RESULTS: In this review, we provide an overview of the 
      potential role of the soil microbiome in production of cannabinoids, and discussed 
      that manipulation of cannabis-associated microbiome obtained through soil amendment 
      interventions of diversified microbial communities sourced from natural forest soil 
      could potentially help producers of cannabis to improve yields of cannabinoids and 
      enhance the balance of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) proportions. 
      CONCLUSION: Cannabis is one of the oldest cultivated crops in history, grown for 
      food, fiber, and drugs for thousands of years. Extension of genetic variation in 
      cannabis has developed into wide-ranging varieties with various complementary 
      phenotypes and secondary metabolites. For medical or pharmaceutical purposes, the 
      ratio of CBD to THC is key. Therefore, studying soil microbiota associated with 
      cannabis and its potential impact on secondary metabolites production could be 
      useful when selecting microorganisms as bioinoculant agents for enhanced organic 
      cannabinoid production.

      Present to Emergency Services.

AB  - Cannabis use is a modifiable risk factor for the development and exacerbation of 
      mental illness. The strongest evidence of risk is for the development of a psychotic 
      disorder, associated with early and consistent use in youth and young adults. 
      Cannabis-related mental health adverse events precipitating Emergency Department 
      (ED) or Emergency Medical Services presentations can include anxiety, suicidal 
      thoughts, psychotic or attenuated psychotic symptoms, and can account for 25-30% of 
      cannabis-related ED visits. Up to 50% of patients with cannabis-related psychotic 
      symptoms presenting to the ED requiring hospitalization will go on to develop 
      schizophrenia. With the legalization of cannabis in various jurisdiction and the 
      subsequent emerging focus of research in this area, our understanding of who (e.g., 
      age groups and risk factors) are presenting with cannabis-related adverse mental 
      health events in an emergency situation is starting to become clearer. However, for 
      years we have heard in popular culture that cannabis use is less harmful or no more 
      harmful than alcohol use; however, this does not appear to be the case for everyone. 
      It is evident that these ED presentations should be considered another aspect of 
      potentially harmful outcomes that need to be included in knowledge mobilization. In 
      the absence of a clear understanding of the risk factors for mental health adverse 
      events with cannabis use it can be instructive to examine what characteristics are 
      seen with new presentations of mental illness both in emergency departments (ED) and 
      early intervention services for mental illness. In this narrative review, we will 
      discuss what is currently known about cannabis-related mental illness presentations 
      to the ED, discussing risk variables and outcomes both prior to and after 
      legalization, including our experiences following cannabis legalization in Canada. 
      We will also discuss what is known about cannabis-related ED adverse events based on 
      gender or biological sex. We also touch on the differences in magnitude between the 
      impact of alcohol and cannabis on emergency mental health services to fairly present 
      the differences in service demand with the understanding that these two recreational 
      substances may impact different populations of individuals at risk for adverse 
      events.

AB  - Dampened behavioral inhibition and overactive behavioral approach motivation systems 
      (i.e. BIS/BAS) are associated with cannabis use disorder (CUD), although the 
      underlying neural mechanisms of these alterations have not yet been examined. The 
      brain's executive control network (ECN) plays a role in decision-making and is 
      associated with BIS/BAS. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that altered ECN 
      resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) underlies dysfunctional behavioral 
      inhibition and approach motivation in cannabis users. To that end, we collected 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 86 cannabis using 
      adults and 59 non-using adults to examine group differences in the relationship 
      between ECN rsFC and BIS/BAS. Our results showed that BIS was positively correlated 
      with left ECN rsFC in cannabis users, while it was positively correlated with right 
      ECN rsFC in non-users. There was a trend-level moderation effect of group on the 
      association between BIS/BAS and ECN rsFC, showing a weaker association in BIS/BAS 
      and ECN rsFC in cannabis users compared to non-users. An exploratory mediation 
      analysis found that the severity of CUD mediated the relationship between users' BIS 
      scores and left ECN rsFC. These findings suggest that cannabis use may lead to 
      dysregulation in typical ECN functional organization related to BIS/BAS.

TI  - Cardiovascular Complications of Marijuana and Related Substances: A Review.
PG  - 45-59
LID - 10.1007/s40119-017-0102-x [doi]
AB  - The recreational use of cannabis has sharply increased in recent years in parallel 
      with its legalization and decriminalization in several countries. Commonly, the 
      traditional cannabis has been replaced by potent synthetic cannabinoids and 
      cannabimimetics in various forms. Despite overwhelming public perception of the 
      safety of these substances, an increasing number of serious cardiovascular adverse 
      events have been reported in temporal relation to recreational cannabis use. These 
      have included sudden cardiac death, vascular (coronary, cerebral and peripheral) 
      events, arrhythmias and stress cardiomyopathy among others. Many of the victims of 
      these events are relatively young men with few if any cardiovascular risk factors. 
      However, there are reasons to believe that older individuals and those with risk 
      factors for or established cardiovascular disease are at even higher danger of such 
      events following exposure to cannabis. The pathophysiological basis of these events 
      is not fully understood and likely encompasses a complex interaction between the 
      active ingredients (particularly the major cannabinoid, Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol), 
      and the endo-cannabinoid system, autonomic nervous system, as well as other receptor 
      and non-receptor mediated pathways. Other complicating factors include opposing 
      physiologic effects of other cannabinoids (predominantly cannabidiol), presence of 
      regulatory proteins that act as metabolizing enzymes, binding molecules, or ligands, 
      as well as functional polymorphisms of target receptors. Tolerance to the effects of 
      cannabis may also develop on repeated exposures at least in part due to receptor 
      downregulation or desensitization. Moreover, effects of cannabis may be enhanced or 
      altered by concomitant use of other illicit drugs or medications used for treatment 
      of established cardiovascular diseases. Regardless of these considerations, it is 
      expected that the current cannabis epidemic would add significantly to the universal 
      burden of cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - We applied social network analysis (SNA) to Tweets mentioning cannabis or 
      opioid-related terms to publicly available COVID-19 related Tweets collected from 
      Jan 21st to May 3rd, 2020 (n= 2,558,474 Tweets). We randomly extracted 16,154 Tweets 
      mentioning cannabis and 4,670 Tweets mentioning opioids from the COVID-19 Tweet 
      corpora for our analysis. The cannabis related Tweets created by 6,144 users were 
      disseminated to 280,042,783 users and retweeted 11 times the number of original 
      messages while opioid-related Tweets created by 3,412 users were disseminated to 
      smaller number of users. The opioids Twitter network showed more cohesive online 
      group activities and a cleaner online environment with less disinformation. The 
      cannabis Twitter network showed a less desirable online environment with more 
      disinformation (false information to mislead the public) and stakeholders lacking 
      strong science knowledge. Application of SNA to Tweets provides insights for future 
      online-based drug abuse research during the outbreak.

TI  - Genome-Wide Analysis of Alternative Splicing and Non-Coding RNAs Reveal Complicated 
      Transcriptional Regulation in Cannabis sativa L.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222111989 [doi]
LID - 11989
AB  - It is of significance to mine the structural genes related to the biosynthetic 
      pathway of fatty acid (FA) and cellulose as well as explore the regulatory mechanism 
      of alternative splicing (AS), microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) 
      in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids, FA and cellulose, which would enhance the 
      knowledge of gene expression and regulation at post-transcriptional level in 
      Cannabis sativa L. In this study, transcriptome, small RNA and degradome libraries 
      of hemp 'Yunma No.1' were established, and comprehensive analysis was performed. As 
      a result, a total of 154, 32 and 331 transcripts encoding key enzymes involved in 
      the biosynthesis of cannabinoids, FA and cellulose were predicted, respectively, 
      among which AS occurred in 368 transcripts. Moreover, 183 conserved miRNAs, 380 C. 
      sativa-specific miRNAs and 7783 lncRNAs were predicted. Among them, 70 miRNAs and 17 
      lncRNAs potentially targeted 13 and 17 transcripts, respectively, encoding key 
      enzymes or transporters involved in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids, cellulose or 
      FA. Finally, the crosstalk between AS and miRNAs or lncRNAs involved in cannabinoids 
      and cellulose was also predicted. In summary, all these results provided insights 
      into the complicated network of gene expression and regulation in C. sativa.

TI  - The effect of cannabis use on memory function: an update.
PG  - 11-27
LID - 10.2147/SAR.S25869 [doi]
AB  - Investigating the effects of cannabis use on memory function appears challenging. 
      While early observational investigations aimed to elucidate the longer-term effects 
      of cannabis use on memory function in humans, findings remained equivocal and 
      pointed to a pattern of interacting factors impacting on the relationship between 
      cannabis use and memory function, rather than a simple direct effect of cannabis. 
      Only recently, a clearer picture of the chronic and acute effects of cannabis use on 
      memory function has emerged once studies have controlled for potential confounding 
      factors and started to investigate the acute effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
      (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the main ingredients in the extract of the cannabis 
      plant in pharmacological challenge experiments. Relatively consistent findings have 
      been reported regarding the acute impairments induced by a single dose of Δ9-THC on 
      verbal and working memory. It is unclear whether they may persist beyond the 
      intoxication state. In the long-term, these impairments seem particularly likely to 
      manifest and may also persist following abstinence if regular and heavy use of 
      cannabis strains high in Δ9-THC is started at an early age. Although still at an 
      early stage, studies that employed advanced neuroimaging techniques have started to 
      model the neural underpinnings of the effects of cannabis use and implicate a 
      network of functional and morphological alterations that may moderate the effects of 
      cannabis on memory function. Future experimental and epidemiological studies that 
      take into consideration individual differences, particularly previous cannabis 
      history and demographic characteristics, but also the precise mixture of the 
      ingredients of the consumed cannabis are necessary to clarify the magnitude and the 
      mechanisms by which cannabis-induced memory impairments occur and to elucidate 
      underlying neurobiological mechanisms.

TI  - Dynamic functional connectivity between nucleus accumbens and the central executive 
      network relates to chronic cannabis use.

AB  - The neural mechanisms of drug cue-reactivity regarding the temporal fluctuations of 
      functional connectivity, namely the dynamic connectivity, are sparsely studied. 
      Quantifying the task-modulated variability in dynamic functional connectivity at cue 
      exposure can aid the understanding. We analyzed changes in dynamic connectivity in 
      54 adult cannabis users and 90 controls during a cannabis cue exposure task. The 
      variability was measured as standard deviation in the (a) connectivity weights of 
      the default mode, the central executive, and the salience networks and two reward 
      loci (amygdalae and nuclei accumbens); and (b) topological indexes of the whole 
      brain (global efficiency, modularity and network resilience). These were compared 
      for the main effects of task conditions and the group (users vs. controls), and 
      correlated with pre- and during-scan subjective craving. The variability of 
      connectivity weights between the central executive network and nuclei accumbens was 
      increased in users throughout the cue exposure task, and, was positively correlated 
      with during-scan craving for cannabis. The variability of modularity was not 
      different by groups, but positively correlated with prescan craving. The variability 
      of dynamic connectivity during cannabis cue exposure task between the central 
      executive network and the nuclei accumbens, and, the level of modularity, seem to 
      relate to the neural underpinning of cannabis use and the subjective craving.

TI  - Brain cannabinoid receptor 2: expression, function and modulation.
PG  - 312-316
LID - 10.1038/aps.2016.149 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis sativa (marijuana) is a fibrous flowering plant that produces an abundant 
      variety of molecules, some with psychoactive effects. At least 4% of the world's 
      adult population uses cannabis annually, making it one of the most frequently used 
      illicit drugs in the world. The psychoactive effects of cannabis are mediated 
      primarily through cannabinoid receptor (CBR) subtypes. The prevailing view is that 
      CB1Rs are mainly expressed in the central neurons, whereas CB(2)Rs are predominantly 
      expressed in peripheral immune cells. However, this traditional view has been 
      challenged by emerging strong evidence that shows CB(2)Rs are moderately expressed 
      and function in specific brain areas. New evidence has demonstrated that brain 
      CB(2)Rs modulate animal drug-seeking behaviors, suggesting that these receptors may 
      exist in brain regions that regulate drug addiction. Recently, we further confirmed 
      that functional CB(2)Rs are expressed in mouse ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine 
      (DA) neurons and that the activation of VTA CB(2)Rs reduces neuronal excitability 
      and cocaine-seeking behavior. In addition, CB(2)R-mediated modulation of hippocampal 
      CA3 neuronal excitability and network synchronization has been reported. Here, we 
      briefly summarize recent lines of evidence showing how CB(2)Rs modulate function and 
      pathophysiology in the CNS.

TI  - The Relationship Between Behavioral Inhibition and Approach Motivation Systems 
      (BIS/BAS) and Intrinsic Brain Network Connectivity in Adult Cannabis Users.
LID - nsab054 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/scan/nsab054 [doi]
AB  - Dampened behavioral inhibition and overactive behavioral approach motivation systems 
      (i.e., BIS/BAS) are associated with cannabis use disorder (CUD), although the 
      underlying neural mechanisms of these alterations have not yet been examined. The 
      brain's executive control network (ECN) plays a role in decision-making and is 
      associated with BIS/BAS. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that altered ECN 
      resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) underlies dysfunctional behavioral 
      inhibition and approach motivation in cannabis users. To that end, we collected 
      resting state fMRI scans in 86 cannabis using and 59 non-using adults to examine 
      group differences in the relationship between ECN rsFC and BIS/BAS. Our results 
      showed that BIS was positively correlated with left ECN rsFC in cannabis users, 
      while it was positively correlated with right ECN rsFC in non-users. There was a 
      trend-level moderation effect of group on the association between BIS/BAS and ECN 
      rsFC showing weaker association in BIS/BAS and ECN rsFC in the cannabis users 
      compared to non-users. An exploratory mediation analysis found that severity of CUD 
      mediated the relationship between users' BIS scores and left ECN rsFC. These 
      findings suggest that cannabis use may lead to dysregulation in typical ECN 
      functional organization related to BIS/BAS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether kidney donation leads to lifestyle changes in 
      terms of cannabis and cigarette use. OBJECTIVE: To describe cigarette and cannabis 
      use before and after kidney donation and to determine their associations with 
      lifestyle and clinical factors. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The 
      Living Kidney Donor program in the Champlain Local Health Integration Network at The 
      Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa, Canada. PATIENTS: The study included 178 living kidney 
      donors who donated between January 2009 and December 2018. MEASUREMENTS: Donors were 
      screened for cannabis and cigarette use by telephone interview. Their clinical 
      characteristics and changes in kidney function before and after donation were 
      recorded. METHODS: Cannabis and cigarette use before and after kidney donation were 
      compared using chi-square test. Risk factors associated with their use was examined 
      by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used 
      to examine the association of cannabis and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
      Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 
      donation and at last follow-up. T-test was used to examine the association of 
      cigarette smoking and CKD-EPI eGFR at donation and at last follow-up. RESULTS: Among 
      305 donors, 262 met inclusion criteria and 178 participated (mean of 4.7 ± 2.9 years 
      from kidney donation). Cannabis and cigarette use were reported by 5% (9 of 178) and 
      13% (23 of 178) at donation. After donation, 8% (14 of 178) and 5% (9 of 178) 
      started cannabis and cigarettes, respectively; 74% (17 of 23) of smokers remained 
      smokers after donation and 88% (53 of 60) who quit smoking before donation did not 
      restart after donation. In multivariate analysis, non-married/common-in-law status 
      was associated with cannabis use (odds ratio, 2.73; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.05-7.11; P = .04). There was no difference in eGFR pre- or post-donation among 
      cannabis or cigarette users. LIMITATIONS: The single-center study design limits 
      generalizability. Social desirability bias may have affected survey responses and 
      cigarette smoking was not quantified. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis and cigarette use was 
      uncommon in the studied population and was not associated with remaining kidney 
      function. Cannabis use increased post-donation. Most smokers remained smokers after 
      donation and most donors who quit smoking before donation did not restart after 
      donation. This warrants education and support for potential donors who smoke, to 
      quit smoking prior to donation to reduce risks of cardiovascular and end-stage 
      kidney disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable as this is not a clinical trial.

TI  - Change over time in adolescent smoking, cannabis use and their association: findings 
      from the School Health Research Network in Wales.
PG  - e620-e628
LID - 10.1093/pubmed/fdaa174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While tobacco smoking has declined among UK youth in recent decades, 
      cannabis use has begun to show some growth. Given their interrelationship, growth in 
      cannabis use may act as a barrier to continued reduction in youth smoking. This 
      paper assesses recent tobacco and cannabis use trends in Wales, and their 
      association, to explore whether change in cannabis use might have impacted youth 
      tobacco smoking prevalence. METHODS: Repeat cross-sectional data on tobacco and 
      cannabis use were obtained from biennial Welsh Student Health and Wellbeing surveys 
      between 2013 and 2019. Data were pooled and analysed using logistic regression with 
      adjustment for school-level clustering. RESULTS: No change in regular youth tobacco 
      smoking was observed between 2013 and 2019. In contrast, current cannabis use 
      increased during this time, and cannabis users had significantly greater odds of 
      regular tobacco smoking. After adjusting for change in cannabis use, a significant 
      decline in youth tobacco smoking was observed (OR 0.95; 95% confidence intervals: 
      0.92, 0.97). CONCLUSION: Recent growth in cannabis use among young people in Wales 
      may have offset prospective declines in regular tobacco smoking. Further reductions 
      in youth smoking may require more integrated policy approaches to address the co-use 
      of tobacco and cannabis among adolescents.

TI  - The Endocannabinoid System and Cannabidiol: Past, Present, and Prospective for 
      Cardiovascular Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/ph14090936 [doi]
LID - 936
AB  - In the past, cannabis was commonly associated with mysticism and illegality. 
      Fortunately, in recent years perspectives and discourses have changed. More 
      prominence has been given to the rigorous scientific effort that led to the 
      discovery of cannabis' many physiological actions and endogenous signalling 
      mechanisms. The endocannabinoid system is a complex and heterogeneous 
      pro-homeostatic network comprising different receptors with several endogenous 
      ligands, numerous metabolic enzymes and regulatory proteins. Therefore, it is not 
      surprising that alterations and dysfunctions of the endocannabinoid system are 
      observed in almost every category of disease. Such high degree of pathophysiological 
      involvement suggests the endocannabinoid system is a promising therapeutic target 
      and prompted the translation of resurgent scientific findings into clinical 
      therapies. Shifting attitudes toward cannabis also raised other matters such as 
      increased patient awareness, prescription requests, self-medication, recreational 
      use, recognition of new knowledge gaps, renewed scientific activity, and seemingly 
      exponential growth of the cannabis industry. This review, following a general 
      overview of cannabis and the endocannabinoid system, assiduously describes its role 
      within the context of cardiovascular diseases, paying particular attention to the 
      Janus influence that endocannabinoid system modulators can have on the 
      cardiovascular system.

TI  - The role of cannabinoids in adult neurogenesis.
PG  - 3950-63
LID - 10.1111/bph.13186 [doi]
AB  - The processes underpinning post-developmental neurogenesis in the mammalian brain 
      continue to be defined. Such processes involve the proliferation of neural stem 
      cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neuronal migration, differentiation and 
      integration into a network of functional synapses within the brain. Both intrinsic 
      (cell signalling cascades) and extrinsic (neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, 
      cytokines, hormones) signalling molecules are intimately associated with adult 
      neurogenesis and largely dictate the proliferative activity and differentiation 
      capacity of neural cells. Cannabinoids are a unique class of chemical compounds 
      incorporating plant-derived cannabinoids (the active components of Cannabis sativa), 
      the endogenous cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid ligands, and these compounds 
      are becoming increasingly recognized for their roles in neural developmental 
      processes. Indeed, cannabinoids have clear modulatory roles in adult neurogenesis, 
      probably through activation of both CB1 and CB2 receptors. In recent years, a large 
      body of literature has deciphered the signalling networks involved in 
      cannabinoid-mediated regulation of neurogenesis. This timely review summarizes the 
      evidence that the cannabinoid system is intricately associated with neuronal 
      differentiation and maturation of NPCs and highlights intrinsic/extrinsic signalling 
      mechanisms that are cannabinoid targets. Overall, these findings identify the 
      central role of the cannabinoid system in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and 
      the lateral ventricles and hence provide insight into the processes underlying 
      post-developmental neurogenesis in the mammalian brain.

TI  - Association of Cannabis Use During Adolescence With Neurodevelopment.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1258 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Animal studies have shown that the adolescent brain is sensitive to 
      disruptions in endocannabinoid signaling, resulting in altered neurodevelopment and 
      lasting behavioral effects. However, few studies have investigated ties between 
      cannabis use and adolescent brain development in humans. OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      degree to which magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-assessed cerebral cortical thickness 
      development is associated with cannabis use in a longitudinal sample of adolescents. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the community-based 
      IMAGEN cohort study, conducted across 8 European sites. Baseline data used in the 
      present study were acquired from March 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011, and follow-up 
      data were acquired from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016. A total of 799 IMAGEN 
      participants were identified who reported being cannabis naive at study baseline and 
      had behavioral and neuroimaging data available at baseline and 5-year follow-up. 
      Statistical analysis was performed from October 1, 2019, to August 31, 2020. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cannabis use was assessed at baseline and 5-year follow-up 
      with the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs. Anatomical MR 
      images were acquired with a 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization prepared 
      gradient echo sequence. Quality-controlled native MR images were processed through 
      the CIVET pipeline, version 2.1.0. RESULTS: The study evaluated 1598 MR images from 
      799 participants (450 female participants [56.3%]; mean [SD] age, 14.4 [0.4] years 
      at baseline and 19.0 [0.7] years at follow-up). At 5-year follow-up, cannabis use 
      (from 0 to >40 uses) was negatively associated with thickness in left prefrontal 
      (peak: t785 = -4.87, cluster size = 1558 vertices; P = 1.10 × 10-6, random field 
      theory cluster corrected) and right prefrontal (peak: t785 = -4.27, cluster 
      size = 1551 vertices; P = 2.81 × 10-5, random field theory cluster corrected) 
      cortices. There were no significant associations between lifetime cannabis use at 
      5-year follow-up and baseline cortical thickness, suggesting that the observed 
      neuroanatomical differences did not precede initiation of cannabis use. Longitudinal 
      analysis revealed that age-related cortical thinning was qualified by cannabis use 
      in a dose-dependent fashion such that greater use, from baseline to follow-up, was 
      associated with increased thinning in left prefrontal (peak: t815.27 = -4.24, 
      cluster size = 3643 vertices; P = 2.28 × 10-8, random field theory cluster 
      corrected) and right prefrontal (peak: t813.30 = -4.71, cluster size = 2675 
      vertices; P = 3.72 × 10-8, random field theory cluster corrected) cortices. The 
      spatial pattern of cannabis-related thinning was associated with age-related 
      thinning in this sample (r = 0.540; P < .001), and a positron emission 
      tomography-assessed cannabinoid 1 receptor-binding map derived from a separate 
      sample of participants (r = -0.189; P < .001). Analysis revealed that thinning in 
      right prefrontal cortices, from baseline to follow-up, was associated with 
      attentional impulsiveness at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results suggest 
      that cannabis use during adolescence is associated with altered neurodevelopment, 
      particularly in cortices rich in cannabinoid 1 receptors and undergoing the greatest 
      age-related thickness change in middle to late adolescence.

      Problematic Cannabis Users: A Preliminary EEG Coherence Study.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci10030136 [doi]
LID - 136
AB  - An increasing body of experimental data have suggested that aberrant functional 
      interactions between large-scale networks may be the most plausible explanation of 
      psychopathology across multiple mental disorders, including substance-related and 
      addictive disorders. In the current research, we have investigated the association 
      between problematic cannabis use (PCU) and triple-network electroencephalographic 
      (EEG) functional connectivity. Twelve participants with PCU and 24 non-PCU 
      participants were included in the study. EEG recordings were performed during 
      resting state (RS). The exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography software 
      (eLORETA) was used for all EEG analyses. Compared to non-PCU, PCU participants 
      showed an increased delta connectivity between the salience network (SN) and central 
      executive network (CEN), specifically, between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
      and right posterior parietal cortex. The strength of delta connectivity between the 
      SN and CEN was positively and significantly correlated with higher problematic 
      patterns of cannabis use after controlling for age, sex, educational level, tobacco 
      use, problematic alcohol use, and general psychopathology (r(p) = 0.40, p = 0.030). 
      Taken together, our results show that individuals with PCU could be characterized by 
      a specific dysfunctional interaction between the SN and CEN during RS, which might 
      reflect the neurophysiological underpinnings of attentional and emotional processes 
      of cannabis-related thoughts, memories, and craving.

AB  - Cue-elicited craving or the intense desire to consume a substance following exposure 
      to a conditioned drug cue is one of the primary behavioral symptoms of substance use 
      disorders (SUDs). While the concept of cue-elicited craving is well characterized in 
      alcohol and other substances of abuse, only recently has it been described in 
      cannabis. A review of the extant literature has established that cue-elicited 
      craving is a powerful reinforcer that contributes to drug-seeking for cannabis. 
      Further, emergent research has begun to identify the neurobiological systems and 
      neural mechanisms associated with this behavior. What research shows is that while 
      theories of THC's effects on the dopaminergic-reward system remain divergent, 
      cannabis cues elicit neural activation in the brain's reward network.

TI  - Cannabis use and resting state functional connectivity in adolescent bipolar 
      disorder.
PG  - E559-E567
LID - 10.1503/jpn.200228 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescents with bipolar disorder have high rates of cannabis use, and 
      cannabis use is associated with increased symptom severity and treatment resistance 
      in bipolar disorder. Studies have identified anomalous resting-state functional 
      connectivity among reward networks in bipolar disorder and cannabis use 
      independently, but have yet to examine their convergence. METHODS: Participants 
      included 134 adolescents, aged 13 to 20 years: 40 with bipolar disorder and lifetime 
      cannabis use, 31 with bipolar disorder and no history of cannabis use, and 63 
      healthy controls without lifetime cannabis use. We used a seed-to-voxel analysis to 
      assess the restingstate functional connectivity of the amygdala, the nucleus 
      accumbens and the orbitofrontal cortex, regions implicated in bipolar disorder and 
      cannabis use. We used a generalized linear model to explore bivariate correlations 
      for each seed, controlling for age and sex. RESULTS: We found 3 significant 
      clusters. Resting-state functional connectivity between the left nucleus accumbens 
      seed and the left superior parietal lobe was negative in adolescents with bipolar 
      disorder and no history of cannabis use, and positive in healthy controls. 
      Resting-state functional connectivity between the right orbitofrontal cortex seed 
      and the right lateral occipital cortex was positive in adolescents with bipolar 
      disorder and lifetime cannabis use, and negative in healthy controls and adolescents 
      with bipolar disorder and no history of cannabis use. Resting-state functional 
      connectivity between the right orbitofrontal cortex seed and right occipital pole 
      was positive in adolescents with bipolar disorder and lifetime cannabis use, and 
      negative in adolescents with bipolar disorder and no history of cannabis use. 
      LIMITATIONS: The study did not include a cannabis-using control group. CONCLUSION: 
      This study provides preliminary evidence of cannabis-related differences in 
      functional reward circuits in adolescents with bipolar disorder. Further studies are 
      necessary to evaluate whether the present findings reflect consequences of or 
      predisposition to cannabis use.

TI  - Foreign investment in emerging legal medicinal cannabis markets: the Jamaica case 
      study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The establishment of a legal market for medicinal cannabis under the 
      Dangerous Drugs Amendment Act 2015 has positioned Jamaica at the forefront of 
      cannabis law reform in the developing world. Many local cannabis businesses have 
      attracted investment from overseas, including from Canada, US and Europe. AIM: To 
      explore the opportunities and risks of foreign investment in an emerging domestic 
      legal cannabis market in a developing country. METHODS: Thematic analysis of 
      semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 22 key informants (KIs) from the 
      Jamaican government, local cannabis industry, academia and civil society, and field 
      observations of legal and illegal cannabis cultivators. RESULTS: KIs from the 
      Jamaican public agencies and domestic cannabis entrepreneurs saw foreign investment 
      as an essential source of capital to finance the start-up costs of legal cannabis 
      businesses. Local cannabis entrepreneurs prioritised investors with the greatest 
      financial resources, brand reputation and export networks. They also considered how 
      allied an investor was with their business vision (e.g., organic cultivation, 
      medical vs. recreational). The key benefits of partnering with a foreign investor 
      included transfer of technical knowledge and financial capital, which enhanced 
      production, quality assurance and seed-to-sale tracking. Some KIs expressed concern 
      over investors' focus on increasing production efficiency and scale at the expense 
      of funding research and development (R&D) and clinical trials. KIs from the local 
      industry, government agencies and civil society highlighted the risks of 'predatory' 
      shareholder agreements and domestic political interference. Concerns were raised 
      about the impact of foreign investment on the diversity of the domestic cannabis 
      sector in Jamaica, including the commitment to transition traditional illegal 
      small-scale cannabis cultivators to the legal sector. CONCLUSION: While foreign 
      investment has facilitated the commercialisation of the cannabis sector in Jamaica, 
      regulatory measures are also needed to protect the domestic industry and support the 
      transition of small-scale illegal cultivators to the legal regime. Foreign 
      investments may alter the economic, social and political determinants of health in 
      transitioning from illegal to legal cannabis market economy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is common for cannabis users to also use tobacco. While data suggest 
      that tobacco users have more difficulty achieving cannabis cessation, secondary 
      analyses of clinical trial data sets may provide insight into the moderating 
      variables contributing to this relationship, as well as changes in tobacco use 
      during cannabis treatment. Those were the aims of this secondary analysis. METHODS: 
      The parent study was a multi-site trial of N-acetylcysteine for cannabis dependence 
      conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. 
      Participants were treatment-seeking adults (ages 18-50) who met criteria for 
      cannabis dependence (N = 302). For cigarette smokers (n = 117), tobacco use was 
      assessed via timeline follow-back and nicotine dependence was assessed via the 
      Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Outcome measures included: 1) 
      changes in tobacco use based on treatment assignment, nicotine dependence, and 
      concurrent cannabis reduction/abstinence, and 2) independent associations between 
      nicotine dependence and cannabis abstinence. RESULTS: Cigarette smokers accounted 
      for 39% of the sample (117/302), with a median FTND score of 3.0 (10-point scale). 
      Among those with lower baseline nicotine dependence scores, cigarette smoking was 
      reduced in the active treatment group compared to placebo. Those with moderate/high 
      levels of nicotine dependence showed slight increases in smoking following active 
      treatment. Nicotine dependence did not affect cannabis cessation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cigarette smoking during cannabis treatment was affected, but depended on baseline 
      nicotine dependence severity, though dependence levels did not impact cannabis 
      abstinence. Interventions that address both tobacco and cannabis are needed, 
      especially due to an increasing prevalence of cannabis use.

AB  - Cannabinoids and Cannabis-derived compounds have been receiving especial attention 
      in the epilepsy research scenario. Pharmacological modulation of endocannabinoid 
      system's components, like cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1R) and their bindings, 
      are associated with seizures in preclinical models. CB1R expression and 
      functionality were altered in humans and preclinical models of seizures. 
      Additionally, Cannabis-derived compounds, like cannabidiol (CBD), present 
      anticonvulsant activity in humans and in a great variety of animal models. 
      Audiogenic seizures (AS) are induced in genetically susceptible animals by 
      high-intensity sound stimulation. Audiogenic strains, like the Genetically Epilepsy 
      Prone Rats, Wistar Audiogenic Rats, and Krushinsky-Molodkina, are useful tools to 
      study epilepsy. In audiogenic susceptible animals, acute acoustic stimulation 
      induces brainstem-dependent wild running and tonic-clonic seizures. However, during 
      the chronic protocol of AS, the audiogenic kindling (AuK), limbic and cortical 
      structures are recruited, and the initially brainstem-dependent seizures give rise 
      to limbic seizures. The present study reviewed the effects of pharmacological 
      modulation of the endocannabinoid system in audiogenic seizure susceptibility and 
      expression. The effects of Cannabis-derived compounds in audiogenic seizures were 
      also reviewed, with especial attention to CBD. CB1R activation, as well 
      Cannabis-derived compounds, induced anticonvulsant effects against audiogenic 
      seizures, but the effects of cannabinoids modulation and Cannabis-derived compounds 
      still need to be verified in chronic audiogenic seizures. The effects of 
      cannabinoids and Cannabis-derived compounds should be further investigated not only 
      in audiogenic seizures, but also in epilepsy related comorbidities present in 
      audiogenic strains, like anxiety, and depression.

AB  - In the United States (US), three in 10 cannabis users develop cannabis use disorder 
      (CUD). Usage patterns in line with CUD may be associated with socio-economic 
      disadvantage, and other negative effects. Thus, research on CUD is paramount. To 
      provide understanding around CUD, it is necessary to detail granular cannabis usage 
      preferences, as some risk from cannabis use may be mitigated through informed 
      behavioral choices by users. We describe cannabis usage preferences among US Global 
      Drug Survey (GDS) respondents, primarily young men. The cross-sectional web-based 
      GDS (2017) was completed by 8345 US-resident respondents (median age = 23, 
      Interquartile Range 19-32; % male = 75.48) who reported cannabis use. Of those who 
      reported cannabis use in the past year, most (78%) reported consuming their first 
      joint more than an hour after waking, and about half the sample (49%) had their last 
      joint 1-2 h before bed. Cannabis was used for a median of 250 days in the last year 
      (almost daily). Respondents spent a median of four hours a day stoned when cannabis 
      was used. High potency herbal cannabis was the preferred variant by 62% of 
      participants. We suggest that frequent use of cannabis may increase risk of health 
      harms, and highlight the need to mitigate problematic use. With the rapidly 
      developing US cannabis market, possibly problematic usage patterns may indicate 
      potential for CUD especially within young men.

TI  - The Effects of Cannabis on Female Reproductive Health Across the Life Course.
PG  - 275-287
LID - 10.1089/can.2020.0065 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Cannabis is commonly used for its medicinal and therapeutic benefits 
      and is also widely used as a recreational drug. Cannabis use has been increasing in 
      Canada, including among Canadian women of reproductive age. Post-legalization, 
      further increases in cannabis use are expected due to increased availability and 
      lowered perceptions of harm. Although cannabinoids are well known for their effects 
      on the central and peripheral nervous systems, endocannabinoid receptors have also 
      been characterized throughout the female reproductive tract. Cannabinoids may affect 
      many aspects of female reproductive health, including fertility, pregnancy outcomes 
      with neonatal implications, and menopause. Purpose: To provide a comprehensive 
      review of trends in cannabis use among women and review the impact of cannabis 
      across the female reproductive lifespan. Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane 
      Library databases using keywords and MeSH terms. Included studies reported the 
      potential impact of cannabinoids on female fertility, pregnancy, transmission to 
      breast milk, neonatal outcomes, and menopause. Results: The existing literature is 
      primarily concentrated on the effect of cannabis use in pregnancy and breastfeeding, 
      with little exploration of its impact on fertility and in later life. Studies are 
      limited in number, with small sample sizes, and are hampered by methodological 
      challenges related to confounding and other potential biases. Conclusions: There 
      remain critical gaps in the literature about the potential risks of cannabis use, 
      particularly in vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, women who are 
      breastfeeding, and their infants. Given the rise in the prevalence of cannabis use, 
      new, robust investigations into the consequences of cannabis exposure on female 
      reproductive health are needed.

      Carbohydrate Sources.

AB  - Micropropagation techniques offer opportunity to proliferate, maintain, and study 
      dynamic plant responses in highly controlled environments without confounding 
      external influences, forming the basis for many biotechnological applications. With 
      medicinal and recreational interests for Cannabis sativa L. growing, research 
      related to the optimization of in vitro practices is needed to improve current 
      methods while boosting our understanding of the underlying physiological processes. 
      Unfortunately, due to the exorbitantly large array of factors influencing tissue 
      culture, existing approaches to optimize in vitro methods are tedious and 
      time-consuming. Therefore, there is great potential to use new computational 
      methodologies for analyzing data to develop improved protocols more efficiently. 
      Here, we first tested the effects of light qualities using assorted combinations of 
      Red, Blue, Far Red, and White spanning 0-100 μmol/m(2)/s in combination with sucrose 
      concentrations ranging from 1 to 6% (w/v), totaling 66 treatments, on in vitro shoot 
      growth, root development, number of nodes, shoot emergence, and canopy surface area. 
      Collected data were then assessed using multilayer perceptron (MLP), generalized 
      regression neural network (GRNN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) 
      to model and predict in vitro Cannabis growth and development. Based on the results, 
      GRNN had better performance than MLP or ANFIS and was consequently selected to link 
      different optimization algorithms [genetic algorithm (GA), biogeography-based 
      optimization (BBO), interior search algorithm (ISA), and symbiotic organisms search 
      (SOS)] for prediction of optimal light levels (quality/intensity) and sucrose 
      concentration for various applications. Predictions of in vitro conditions to refine 
      growth responses were subsequently tested in a validation experiment and data showed 
      no significant differences between predicted optimized values and observed data. 
      Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of machine learning and optimization 
      algorithms to predict the most favorable light combinations and sucrose levels to 
      elicit specific developmental responses. Based on these, recommendations of light 
      and carbohydrate levels to promote specific developmental outcomes for in vitro 
      Cannabis are suggested. Ultimately, this work showcases the importance of light 
      quality and carbohydrate supply in directing plant development as well as the power 
      of machine learning approaches to investigate complex interactions in plant tissue 
      culture.

AB  - Medical cannabis access has been legalized in more than 30 countries worldwide and 
      popularity among patients is increasing rapidly. Cannabinoid-based treatments have 
      been shown to be beneficial for several symptoms such as chemotherapy-induced nausea 
      and vomiting, spasticity, chronic pain, intractable seizures and insomnia, yet 
      high-quality clinical trials are still limited. As millions of patients now have 
      legal access to medical cannabis, little information is available about the 
      development of best clinical practices and an effective medical cannabis clinic 
      model. A medical cannabis clinic is an innovative and emergent practice model that 
      may be necessary to bridge the gap between patient and healthcare provider interest 
      and existing barriers to the prescription of medical cannabis treatments, such as 
      limited medical education, lack of high-quality clinical research and challenging or 
      evolving regulatory frameworks. In this paper, we describe the model of care and 
      organization of a dedicated medical cannabis clinic operating in Quebec, Canada 
      since 2014. We share the principles of medical cannabis practice, including the 
      structure of its medical and support team, clinic organisation and procedure 
      guidelines. Key clinic statistics and patient demographics are shared with year by 
      year comparison. Operating since 2014, the clinic has endured a rapidly changing 
      regulatory landscape in Canada, overcoming numerous challenges including medical and 
      social stigma, limited funding, resources and institutional support combined with a 
      high demand for services. To support medical cannabis leaders globally, an important 
      knowledge-sharing is required. The clinic has expanded to a network of four clinic 
      sites across Quebec and offers continuing education and preceptorships to health 
      care providers and trainees as well as research services to both academic and 
      industry partners. The description of the clinic offers guidance on medical cannabis 
      treatment and care and discusses possible solutions to associated challenges. The 
      clinic model of care can be adapted to different healthcare settings and regulatory 
      frameworks; it may assist physicians and health care providers in the development of 
      medical cannabis clinics or the implementation of best practices as medical cannabis 
      access continues to evolve.

TI  - Authorization Patterns, Safety, and Effectiveness of Medical Cannabis in Quebec.
PG  - 564-572
LID - 10.1089/can.2020.0140 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Despite increasing demand for data, little is known about the 
      authorization patterns, safety, and effectiveness of medical cannabis products. 
      Materials and Methods: We conducted a 2 year observational study of adult patients 
      who were legally authorized a medical cannabis product from a single licensed 
      producer; we captured and analyzed authorized cannabis use patterns by cannabinoid 
      profile (tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]-dominant; cannabidiol [CBD]-dominant; and 
      balanced (THC:CBD) and clinical outcomes using standardized outcome measures every 3 
      months for 12 months at a network of medical cannabis clinics in Quebec, Canada. 
      Results: We recruited 585 patients (average age 56.5 years), of whom 61% identified 
      as female and 85% reported pain as their primary complaint. Over 12 months, there 
      was a significant increase in the number of products authorized (Z=2.59, p=0.01). 
      The proportion of authorizations for a THC-dominant or CBD-dominant product 
      increased relative to the proportion of authorizations for a balanced (THC:CBD) 
      product (all p<0.01). Symptom improvement over time was observed for pain, 
      tiredness, drowsiness, anxiety, and well-being. Patients authorized THC-dominant 
      products exhibited less symptom improvement for anxiety and well-being relative to 
      those authorized CBD-dominant or balanced (THC:CBD) products. Medical cannabis was 
      well tolerated across all product profiles. Conclusion: These real-world data reveal 
      changes in medical cannabis authorization patterns and suggest that symptom 
      improvement may vary by cannabinoid profile over 12 months of follow-up.

TI  - Association between age of cannabis initiation and gray matter covariance networks 
      in recent onset psychosis.
PG  - 1484-1493
LID - 10.1038/s41386-021-00977-9 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis use during adolescence is associated with an increased risk of developing 
      psychosis. According to a current hypothesis, this results from detrimental effects 
      of early cannabis use on brain maturation during this vulnerable period. However, 
      studies investigating the interaction between early cannabis use and brain 
      structural alterations hitherto reported inconclusive findings. We investigated 
      effects of age of cannabis initiation on psychosis using data from the multicentric 
      Personalized Prognostic Tools for Early Psychosis Management (PRONIA) and the 
      Cannabis Induced Psychosis (CIP) studies, yielding a total sample of 102 
      clinically-relevant cannabis users with recent onset psychosis. GM covariance 
      underlies shared maturational processes. Therefore, we performed source-based 
      morphometry analysis with spatial constraints on structural brain networks showing 
      significant alterations in schizophrenia in a previous multisite study, thus testing 
      associations of these networks with the age of cannabis initiation and with 
      confounding factors. Earlier cannabis initiation was associated with more severe 
      positive symptoms in our cohort. Greater gray matter volume (GMV) in the previously 
      identified cerebellar schizophrenia-related network had a significant association 
      with early cannabis use, independent of several possibly confounding factors. 
      Moreover, GMV in the cerebellar network was associated with lower volume in another 
      network previously associated with schizophrenia, comprising the insula, superior 
      temporal, and inferior frontal gyrus. These findings are in line with previous 
      investigations in healthy cannabis users, and suggest that early initiation of 
      cannabis perturbs the developmental trajectory of certain structural brain networks 
      in a manner imparting risk for psychosis later in life.

AB  - Approximately 1.8 million young adults aged 18 to 25 had a Cannabis Use Disorder 
      (CUD) in the past year. Unfortunately, engaging young adults in treatment is very 
      challenging. Creative approaches to treat cannabis disorders such as integrating 
      mobile technology with evidence-based treatments are warranted. In light of these 
      challenges, we developed a text message-delivered version of Peer Network Counseling 
      (PNC-txt), which is a substance use intervention that focuses on peer relations. 
      PNC-txt engages participants in 16 automated, personalized text interactions over 
      4weeks. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of PNC-txt 
      against a waitlist control group with 30 treatment seeking young adults (ages 18-25) 
      who met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Self-report and urine analyses were used to test 
      outcomes at the three-month follow-up. The PNC-txt group significantly reduced their 
      cannabis use related problems as well as cannabis cravings, compared to the control 
      group. PNC-txt participants also had a significantly greater percentage with urines 
      negative for cannabis metabolites compared to controls. Moderation analysis showed 
      that CUD severity level moderated treatment, suggesting that PNC-txt is more 
      effective for participants with medium and high levels of CUD severity. All effect 
      sizes ranged from medium to large. Results from this pilot trial are promising and 
      warrant further research on PNC-txt for addressing cannabis use disorder.

AB  - Cannabis use affects cortico-striatal networks that are essential for producing 
      movement. In this review, we summarize the literature on motor system dysfunction in 
      cannabis users and provide a rationale for why motor learning should be considered 
      an important area in cannabis research. A majority of studies have addressed 
      cognitive impairments in cannabis users and some have focused on driving 
      performance, motor impulsivity, and motor inhibition. Our review of the literature 
      has found that cannabis use is associated with motor performance impairments; 
      however, there is a gap in the literature regarding impairments in motor learning. 
      The involvement of the cortico-striatal network in both cannabis addiction and 
      movement also suggests potential avenues for treatment and rehabilitation via the 
      motor system.

TI  - Aberrant structural-functional coupling in adult cannabis users.
PG  - 252-261
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24369 [doi]
AB  - Cellular studies indicate that endocannabinoid type-1 retrograde signaling plays a 
      major role in synaptic plasticity. Disruption of these processes by 
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could produce alterations either in structural 
      and functional brain connectivity or in their association in cannabis (CB) users. 
      Graph theoretic structural and functional networks were generated with diffusion 
      tensor imaging and resting-state functional imaging in 37 current CB users and 31 
      healthy non-users. The primary outcome measures were coupling between structural and 
      functional connectivity, global network characteristics, association between the 
      coupling and network properties, and measures of rich-club organization. 
      Structural-functional (SC-FC) coupling was globally preserved showing a positive 
      association in current CB users. However, the users had disrupted associations 
      between SC-FC coupling and network topological characteristics, most perturbed for 
      shorter connections implying region-specific disruption by CB use. Rich-club 
      analysis revealed impaired SC-FC coupling in the hippocampus and caudate of users. 
      This study provides evidence of the abnormal SC-FC association in CB users. The 
      effect was predominant in shorter connections of the brain network, suggesting that 
      the impact of CB use or predispositional factors may be most apparent in local 
      interconnections. Notably, the hippocampus and caudate specifically showed aberrant 
      structural and functional coupling. These structures have high CB1 receptor density 
      and may also be associated with changes in learning and habit formation that occur 
      with chronic cannabis use.

TI  - Cannabinoids in Glaucoma Patients: The Never-Ending Story.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9123978 [doi]
LID - 3978
AB  - Glaucoma is one of the principal causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Yet, 
      intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main modifiable risk factor for disease 
      progression. In the never-ending challenge to develop new and effective drugs, 
      several molecules have been tested as anti-glaucoma agents thanks to their 
      pressure-lowering capabilities. Among these molecules, the cannabinoids have been 
      investigated as possible anti-glaucoma drugs since the early 1970s. Cannabinoids are 
      a large class of chemical compounds that exploit their effects by interaction with 
      cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2. These receptors are widely expressed in the human 
      retina where they may influence important functions such as photo-transduction, 
      amacrine cell network maintenance, and IOP regulation. Therefore, in past years 
      several studies have been conducted in order to assess the IOP lowering effects of 
      cannabinoids. PRISMA guidelines have been used to perform a literature search on 
      Pubmed and Scopus aiming to investigate the mechanism of IOP lowering effects and 
      the potential benefits of orally administered, inhaled, topical, and intravenous 
      cannabinoids in the treatment of glaucoma patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is concern that cannabis use negatively affects vulnerable groups 
      such as youth; however, the relationship between cannabis use and health care 
      utilization has not been well characterized in this population. We longitudinally 
      evaluated the association between daily cannabis use and hospitalization among a 
      prospective cohort of street-involved youth. METHODS: Data were collected from the 
      At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS) in Vancouver, Canada, from September 2005 to May 2015. 
      Participants were interviewed semi-annually and multivariable generalized estimating 
      equation (GEE) logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between 
      daily cannabis use and hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 1216 participants (31.2% 
      female) were included in this analysis, and 373 (30.7%) individuals reported 
      hospitalization at some point during the study period. In a multivariable GEE 
      analysis, daily cannabis use was not significantly associated with hospitalization 
      (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.17, 95% Confidence interval [CI] = 0.84, 1.65). We 
      did observe a significant interaction between daily cannabis use and sex 
      (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34, 0.77), whereby cannabis use was associated with a 
      decreased odds of hospitalization among males (AOR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.47, 0.78), yet 
      was not significantly associated with hospitalization among females (AOR = 1.19, 95% 
      CI = 0.84, 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that daily cannabis use was not 
      associated with hospitalization among street-involved youth is encouraging given the 
      high rates of cannabis use in this population and the expansion of cannabis 
      legalization and regulation. Future studies, however, are warranted to monitor 
      possible changes in the consequences of cannabis use as cannabis legalization and 
      regulation increase internationally.

AB  - Nearly half of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) have co-occurring cannabis use 
      disorder (CUD), which has been associated with decreased treatment efficacy, 
      increased risk of psychotic relapse, and poor global functioning. While reports on 
      the effects of cannabis on cognitive performance in patients with SCZ have been 
      mixed, study of brain networks related to executive function may clarify the 
      relationship between cannabis use and cognition in these dual-diagnosis patients. In 
      the present pilot study, patients with SCZ and CUD (n=12) and healthy controls 
      (n=12) completed two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting scans. 
      Prior to the second scan, patients smoked a 3.6% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis 
      cigarette or ingested a 15mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) pill. We used 
      resting-state functional connectivity to examine the default mode network (DMN) 
      during both scans, as connectivity/activity within this network is negatively 
      correlated with connectivity of the network involved in executive control and shows 
      reduced activity during task performance in normal individuals. At baseline, 
      relative to controls, patients exhibited DMN hyperconnectivity that correlated with 
      positive symptom severity, and reduced anticorrelation between the DMN and the 
      executive control network (ECN). Cannabinoid administration reduced DMN 
      hyperconnectivity and increased DMN-ECN anticorrelation. Moreover, the magnitude of 
      anticorrelation in the controls, and in the patients after cannabinoid 
      administration, positively correlated with WM performance. The finding that DMN 
      brain connectivity is plastic may have implications for future pharmacotherapeutic 
      development, as treatment efficacy could be assessed through the ability of 
      therapies to normalize underlying circuit-level dysfunction.

AB  - Glandular trichomes are specialized anatomical structures that accumulate secretions 
      with important biological roles in plant-environment interactions. These secretions 
      also have commercial uses in the flavor, fragrance, and pharmaceutical industries. 
      The capitate-stalked glandular trichomes of Cannabis sativa (cannabis), situated on 
      the surfaces of the bracts of the female flowers, are the primary site for the 
      biosynthesis and storage of resins rich in cannabinoids and terpenoids. In this 
      study, we profiled nine commercial cannabis strains with purportedly different 
      attributes, such as taste, color, smell, and genetic origin. Glandular trichomes 
      were isolated from each of these strains, and cell type-specific transcriptome data 
      sets were acquired. Cannabinoids and terpenoids were quantified in flower buds. 
      Statistical analyses indicated that these data sets enable the high-resolution 
      differentiation of strains by providing complementary information. Integrative 
      analyses revealed a coexpression network of genes involved in the biosynthesis of 
      both cannabinoids and terpenoids from imported precursors. Terpene synthase genes 
      involved in the biosynthesis of the major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes routinely 
      assayed by cannabis testing laboratories were identified and functionally evaluated. 
      In addition to cloning variants of previously characterized genes, specifically 
      CsTPS14CT [(-)-limonene synthase] and CsTPS15CT (β-myrcene synthase), we 
      functionally evaluated genes that encode enzymes with activities not previously 
      described in cannabis, namely CsTPS18VF and CsTPS19BL (nerolidol/linalool 
      synthases), CsTPS16CC (germacrene B synthase), and CsTPS20CT (hedycaryol synthase). 
      This study lays the groundwork for developing a better understanding of the complex 
      chemistry and biochemistry underlying resin accumulation across commercial cannabis 
      strains.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Many people use cannabis for medical reasons despite limited evidence of 
      therapeutic benefit and potential risks. Little is known about medical 
      practitioners' documentation of medical cannabis use or clinical characteristics of 
      patients with documented medical cannabis use. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the 
      prevalence of past-year medical cannabis use documented in electronic health records 
      (EHRs) and to describe patients with EHR-documented medical cannabis use, 
      EHR-documented cannabis use without evidence of medical use (other cannabis use), 
      and no EHR-documented cannabis use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      cross-sectional study assessed adult primary care patients who completed a cannabis 
      screen during a visit between November 1, 2017, and October 31, 2018, at a large 
      health system that conducts routine cannabis screening in a US state with legal 
      medical and recreational cannabis use. EXPOSURES: Three mutually exclusive 
      categories of EHR-documented cannabis use (medical, other, and no use) based on 
      practitioner documentation of medical cannabis use in the EHR and patient report of 
      past-year cannabis use at screening. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health conditions 
      for which cannabis use has potential benefits or risks were defined based on 
      National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's review. The adjusted 
      prevalence of conditions diagnosed in the prior year were estimated across 3 
      categories of EHR-documented cannabis use with logistic regression. RESULTS: A total 
      of 185 565 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [18.1] years; 59% female, 73% White, 94% 
      non-Hispanic, and 61% commercially insured) were screened for cannabis use in a 
      primary care visit during the study period. Among these patients, 3551 (2%) had 
      EHR-documented medical cannabis use, 36 599 (20%) had EHR-documented other cannabis 
      use, and 145 415 (78%) had no documented cannabis use. Patients with medical 
      cannabis use had a higher prevalence of health conditions for which cannabis has 
      potential benefits (49.8%; 95% CI, 48.3%-51.3%) compared with patients with other 
      cannabis use (39.9%; 95% CI, 39.4%-40.3%) or no cannabis use (40.0%; 95% CI, 
      39.8%-40.2%). In addition, patients with medical cannabis use had a higher 
      prevalence of health conditions for which cannabis has potential risks (60.7%; 95% 
      CI, 59.0%-62.3%) compared with patients with other cannabis use (50.5%; 95% CI, 
      50.0%-51.0%) or no cannabis use (42.7%; 95% CI, 42.4%-42.9%). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, primary care patients with documented 
      medical cannabis use had a high prevalence of health conditions for which cannabis 
      use has potential benefits, yet a higher prevalence of conditions with potential 
      risks from cannabis use. These findings suggest that practitioners should be 
      prepared to discuss potential risks and benefits of cannabis use with patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of blunt smoking among cannabis users, very 
      few studies examine the clinical profile of blunt smokers relative to those using 
      more common methods of cannabis use, such as joints. METHODS: The current study uses 
      baseline data from the ACCENT (Achieving Cannabis Cessation-Evaluating 
      N-acetylcysteine Treatment) study, a multi-site randomized pharmacotherapy clinical 
      trial within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network, to predict 
      the association between blunt and joint use frequency and cannabis use 
      characteristics (e.g., grams of cannabis used) and consequences (e.g., withdrawal) 
      among past-month cannabis users (N = 377) who were screened for study participation. 
      RESULTS: After controlling for race, age, gender, other forms of cannabis use 
      (including joint use) and nicotine dependence, multivariable linear regression 
      models indicated that the number of days of blunt use in the past month was a 
      significant predictor of the average amount of cannabis per using day (t = 3.04, 
      p <  .01), the estimated average cost of cannabis (t = 2.28, p <  .05) and Cannabis 
      Withdrawal Scale scores (t = 1.94, p <  .05). Frequency of joint use did not 
      significantly predict any of the cannabis use characteristics or consequences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Blunt smokers may present to treatment with greater amounts of cannabis 
      smoked and more intense withdrawal symptoms, which may adversely impact their 
      likelihood of successful abstinence. Cannabis-dependent blunt smokers may be more 
      likely to benefit from treatment that targets physiological and mood-related 
      withdrawal symptoms.

      liver disease were required to demonstrate abstinence for 6 mo to receive a liver 
      transplant. There is no equivalent rule that is applied consistently for cannabis 
      use. There is some evidence that alcohol and cannabis use disorder pretransplant 
      could be associated with worse outcomes posttransplantation. However, early liver 
      transplantation for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease in France and in 
      the United States has led to challenges of the 6-mo abstinence rule in Canada in the 
      media. It has also resulted in several legal challenges arguing that the rule 
      violates human rights laws regarding discrimination in the provision of medical 
      services and that the rule is also unconstitutional (this challenge is still before 
      the court). Recent legalization of cannabis use for adults in Canada has led to 
      questions about the appropriateness of limiting transplant access based on cannabis 
      use. The ethics committee of the Canadian Society of Transplantation was asked to 
      provide an ethical analysis of cannabis and alcohol abstinence policies. Our 
      conclusions were as follows: neither cannabis use nor the 6-mo abstinence rule for 
      alcohol use should be an absolute contraindication to transplantation, and 
      transplant could be offered to selected patients, further research should be 
      conducted to ensure evidence-based policies; and the transplant community has a duty 
      not to perpetuate stigma associated with alcohol and cannabis use disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is increasing among young adults, but its effects on 
      cardiovascular health are poorly understood. We aimed to assess the association 
      between recent cannabis use and history of myocardial infarction (MI) in young 
      adults (aged 18-44 yr). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using pooled 
      data from the 2017 and 2018 cohorts of the American Behavioral Risk Factor 
      Surveillance System survey of US adults. We analyzed the association between any 
      recent cannabis use and history of MI using a weighted logistic regression model 
      that adjusted for demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, health-related 
      behaviours, concomitant substance use and other comorbidities. We also assessed this 
      association after stratifying by frequency of use and by primary method of 
      consumption. RESULTS: Among 33 173 young adults (18.5 million weighted), 4610 
      respondents (3.2 million weighted) reported recent cannabis use (17.5%, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 16.8%-18.2%). A history of MI was more frequent among 
      recent cannabis users (n = 61 of 4610, 1.3%) relative to nonusers (n = 240 of 28 563 
      [0.8%], adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.07, 95% CI 1.12-3.82). A history of MI was 
      associated with cannabis use of more than 4 times per month (adjusted OR 2.31, 95% 
      CI 1.18-4.50), and with smoking as a primary method of consumption (adjusted OR 
      2.01, 95% CI 1.02-3.98). INTERPRETATION: Our study provides evidence supporting an 
      association between recent cannabis use and history of MI in young adults. 
      Increasing cannabis use in an at-risk population could have negative implications 
      for cardiovascular health.

      Facial Expression in Adults With Cannabis Use Disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of stress-related 
      adverse cardiovascular events. Because brain regions of the central autonomic 
      network largely overlap with brain regions related to the neural response to emotion 
      and stress, the central autonomic network may mediate the autonomic response to 
      negative emotional stimuli. We aimed to obtain evidence to determine whether neural 
      connectivity of the central autonomic network is altered in individuals with 
      cannabis use disorder (CUD) when they are exposed to negative emotional stimuli. 
      METHODS: Effective (directional) connectivity (EC) analysis using dynamic causal 
      modeling was applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 23 
      subjects with CUD and 23 control subjects of the Human Connectome Project while they 
      performed an emotional face-matching task with interleaving periods of negative-face 
      (fearful/angry) and neutral-shape stimuli. The EC difference (modulatory change) was 
      measured during the negative-face trials relative to the neutral-shape trials. 
      RESULTS: The CUD group was similar to the control group in nonimaging measures and 
      brain activations but showed greater modulatory changes in left amygdala to 
      hypothalamus EC (positively associated with Perceived Stress Scale score), right 
      amygdala to bilateral fusiform gyri ECs (positively associated with Perceived Stress 
      Scale score), and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to bilateral fusiform gyri 
      ECs (negatively associated with Perceived Stress Scale score). CONCLUSIONS: Left 
      amygdala to hypothalamus EC and right amygdala to bilateral fusiform gyri ECs are 
      possibly part of circuits underlying the risk of individuals with CUD to 
      stress-related disorders. Correspondingly, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to 
      bilateral fusiform gyri ECs are possibly part of circuits reflecting a protective 
      mechanism.

PG  - 435-445
LID - 10.1101/lm.046748.117 [doi]
AB  - The increasing use of cannabis, its derivatives, and synthetic cannabinoids for 
      medicinal and recreational purposes has led to burgeoning interest in understanding 
      the addictive potential of this class of molecules. It is estimated that ∼10% of 
      marijuana users will eventually show signs of dependence on the drug, and the 
      diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) is increasing in the United States. The 
      molecule that sustains the use of cannabis is Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), 
      and our knowledge of its effects, and those of other cannabinoids on brain function 
      has expanded rapidly in the past two decades. Additionally, the identification of 
      endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) systems in brain and their roles in 
      physiology and behavior, demonstrate extensive involvement of these lipid signaling 
      molecules in regulating CNS function. Here, we examine roles for endogenous 
      cannabinoids in shaping synaptic activity in cortical and subcortical brain 
      circuits, and we discuss mechanisms in which exogenous cannabinoids, such as 
      Δ(9)-THC, interact with endocannabinoid systems to disrupt neuronal network 
      oscillations. We then explore how perturbation of the interaction of this activity 
      within brain reward circuits may lead to impaired learning. Finally, we propose that 
      disruption of cellular plasticity mechanisms by exogenous cannabinoids in cortical 
      and subcortical circuits may explain the difficulty in establishing viable 
      cannabinoid self-administration models in animals.

TI  - Cannabis use and work-related injuries: a cross-sectional analysis.
PG  - 570-577
LID - 10.1093/occmed/kqaa175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the association of cannabis use with automobile accidents has 
      been well-studied, the impact of cannabis on workplace safety and injuries is less 
      clear. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between 
      work-related injury and cannabis use in the past year. METHODS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2013-16) of 
      working individuals. We used multiple logistic regression modelling to calculate the 
      odds of experiencing a work-related injury (defined as non-repetitive strain injury) 
      among workers who reported using cannabis more than once during the prior 12 months 
      as compared to non-users. We repeated the analysis among participants working in 
      high injury risk occupational groups only. RESULTS: Among the 136 536 working 
      participants, 2577 (2%) had a work-related injury in the last 12 months. Of these 
      2577 who had a work-related injury, 4% also reported being a cannabis user in the 
      same period. We found no association between past-year cannabis use and work-related 
      injury (odds ratio for work injury among users 0.81, 95% confidence interval 
      0.66-0.99). The association was unchanged in the subgroup analysis limited to high 
      injury risk occupational groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that cannabis 
      users experienced higher rates of work-related injuries. While awaiting prospective 
      studies, occupational medicine practitioners should take a risk-based approach to 
      drafting workplace cannabis policies.

TI  - Understanding the Medical Chemistry of the Cannabis Plant is Critical to Guiding 
      Real World Clinical Evidence.

LID - 4042
AB  - While cannabis has been consumed for thousands of years, the medical-legal landscape 
      surrounding its use has dramatically evolved over the past decades. Patients are 
      turning to cannabis as a therapeutic option for several medical conditions. Given 
      the surge in interest over the past decades there exists a major gap in the 
      literature with respect to understanding the products that are currently being 
      consumed by patients. The current perspective highlights the lack of relevance 
      within the current literature towards understanding the medical chemistry of the 
      products being consumed. The cannabis industry must rigorously invest into 
      understanding what people are consuming from a chemical composition standpoint. This 
      will inform what compounds in addition to Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol 
      may be producing physiologic/therapeutic effects from plant based extracts. Only 
      through real-world evidence and a formalized, granular data collection process 
      within which we know the chemical inputs for patients already using or beginning to 
      use medical cannabis, we can come closer to the ability to provide targeted clinical 
      decision making and design future appropriate randomized controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is a potential risk factor for respiratory disease but its 
      role apart from tobacco use is unclear. We evaluated the association between regular 
      cannabis use, with and without tobacco co-use, and onset of asthma, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia. METHODS: Analysis of a limited 
      data set obtained through IBM Watson Health Explorys, an 
      electronic-health-record-integration platform. Matched controls using Mahalanobis 
      distance within propensity score calipers were defined for: 1) cannabis-using 
      patients (n = 8932); and subgroups of cannabis-using patients: 2) with an encounter 
      diagnosis for tobacco use disorder (TUD; n = 4678); and 3) without a TUD diagnosis 
      (non-TUD; n = 4254). Patients had at least: one recorded blood pressure measurement 
      and one blood chemistry lab result in the MetroHealth System (Cleveland, Ohio). 
      Cannabis-using patients had an encounter diagnosis of cannabis abuse/dependence 
      and/or ≥2 cannabis-positive urine drug screens (UDSs). Control patients, not having 
      cannabis-related diagnoses or cannabis-positive UDSs, were matched to the 
      cannabis-using patients on demographics, residential zip code median income, body 
      mass index, and, for the total sample, TUD-status. RESULTS: Regular cannabis use was 
      significantly associated with greater risk for asthma (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44; 
      adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.50; OR = 1.32), COPD (OR = 1.56; aOR = 1.44; 
      OR = 2.17), and pneumonia (OR = 1.80; OR = 1.84; OR = 2.13) in the total sample and 
      TUD and non-TUD subgroups, respectively. TUD-patients had the greatest prevalence of 
      respiratory disease, regardless of cannabis-use indication. CONCLUSIONS: Regular 
      cannabis use is associated with significantly greater risk of respiratory disease 
      regardless of TUD status. Future research to understand the impact of cannabis use 
      on respiratory health is warranted.

AB  - It is well established that cannabis use promotes appetite. However, how cannabis 
      interacts with the brain's appetite center, the hypothalamus, to stimulate feeding 
      behavior is unknown. A growing body of evidence indicates that the hypothalamic 
      transcriptome programs energy balance. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cannabis 
      targets alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites within hypothalamic transcripts to 
      regulate transcriptomic function. To do this, we used a novel cannabis vapor 
      exposure model to characterize feeding in adult male Long Evans rats and aligned 
      this behavioral response with APA events using a Whole Transcriptome Termini 
      Sequencing (WTTS-Seq) approach as well as functional RNA abundance measurements with 
      real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions. We found that vapor cannabis 
      exposure promoted food intake in free-feeding and behaviorally sated rats, 
      validating the appetite stimulating properties of cannabis. Our WTTS-Seq analysis 
      mapped 59 unique cannabis-induced hypothalamic APAs that occurred primarily within 
      exons on transcripts that regulate synaptic function, excitatory synaptic 
      transmission, and dopamine signaling. Importantly, APA insertions regulated RNA 
      abundance of Slc6a3, the dopamine transporter, suggesting a novel genetic link for 
      cannabis regulation of brain monoamine function. Collectively, these novel data 
      indicate that a single cannabis exposure rapidly targets a key RNA processing 
      mechanism linked to brain transcriptome function.

TI  - A reciprocal effects analysis of cannabis use and perceptions of risk.
PG  - 1077-1085
LID - 10.1111/add.14174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adolescents and young adults increasingly view cannabis as a 
      relatively safe drug. Perception of risk associated with cannabis use is correlated 
      negatively with the prevalence of use, but the causal nature of this association is 
      debated. The aim of this study is to quantitate the reciprocal associations between 
      cannabis use and risk perception in a longitudinal panel of emerging adults. DESIGN: 
      Observational study of longitudinal data from the Monitoring the Future longitudinal 
      study using autoregressive cross-lagged panel analyses to investigate reciprocal 
      associations between cannabis risk perception and frequency of past-year cannabis 
      use. SETTING: Surveys administered to 12th-grade students from the United States 
      general population. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9929 12th-grade students (mean age 18.0 
      years) who were surveyed initially during 2000-05 and follow-up data until 
      approximately 23-24 years old (three waves; n = 9929). MEASUREMENTS: Perception of 
      risk association with cannabis use and frequency of past-year cannabis use. RESULTS: 
      At baseline, 33% of the 12th-graders used cannabis in the past year versus 28% by 
      the third follow-up; 83% believed that smoking cannabis regularly carried moderate 
      or great risk versus 78% by the third follow-up. All cross-lagged paths in both 
      directions were statistically significant (all P < 0.001), consistent with 
      reciprocal influences between cannabis use and risk perception. The negative 
      association between past-year cannabis use and subsequent risk perception 
      (standardized coefficient range -0.21 to -0.27) was stronger than that between risk 
      perception and subsequent use (standardized coefficient range -0.08 to -0.11; 
      confidence intervals did not overlap with those for the coefficients reported 
      above). Similar results were obtained when the analysis was limited to those who had 
      never used cannabis prior to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal associations 
      between cannabis use and perception of risks from cannabis use are reciprocal in 
      nature, with a stronger association between cannabis use and lower subsequent risk 
      perception.

TI  - Problems with the identification of 'problematic' cannabis use: examining the issues 
      of frequency, quantity, and drug use environment.

LID - 10.1159/000360697 [doi]
AB  - Considerable recent attention has focused on how harmful or problematic cannabis use 
      is defined and understood in the literature and put to use in clinical practice. The 
      aim of the current study is to review conceptual and measurement shortcomings in the 
      identification of problematic cannabis use, drawing on the WHO ASSIST instrument for 
      specific examples. Three issues with the current approach are debated and discussed: 
      (1) the identification of problematic cannabis use disproportionately relies on 
      measures of the frequency of cannabis consumption rather than the harms experienced; 
      (2) the quantity consumed on a typical day is not considered when assessing 
      problematic use, and (3) screening tools for problematic use employ a 
      'one-size-fits-all approach' and fail to reflect on the drug use context (networks 
      and environment). Our commentary tackles each issue, with a review of relevant 
      literature coupled with analyses of two Canadian data sources--a representative 
      sample of the Canadian adult population and a smaller sample of adult, regular, 
      long-term cannabis users from four Canadian cities--to further articulate each 
      point. This article concludes with a discussion of appropriate treatment 
      interventions and approaches to reduce cannabis-related harms, and offers suggested 
      changes to improve the measurement of problematic cannabis use.

TI  - Chemical Profiling of Medical Cannabis Extracts.
PG  - 6091-6103
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.7b00996 [doi]
AB  - Medical cannabis has been legally available for patients in a number of countries. 
      Licensed producers produce a variety of cannabis strains with different 
      concentrations of phytocannabinoids. Phytocannabinoids in medical cannabis are 
      decarboxylated when subjected to heating for consumption by the patients or when 
      extracted for preparing cannabis derivative products. There is little understanding 
      of the true chemical composition of cannabis extracts, changes occurring during 
      heating of the extracts, and their relevance to pharmacological effects. We 
      investigated the extract from a popular commercial strain of medical cannabis, prior 
      to and after decarboxylation, to understand the chemical profiles. A total of up to 
      62 compounds could be identified simultaneously in the extract derived from 
      commercial cannabis, including up to 23 phytocannabinoids. Upon heating, several 
      chemical changes take place, including the loss of carboxylic group from the acidic 
      phytocannabinoids. This investigation attempts to reveal the chemical complexity of 
      commercial medical cannabis extracts and the differences in the chemical composition 
      of the native extract and the one subjected to heat. Comprehensive chemical analyses 
      of medical cannabis extracts are needed for standardization, consistency, and, more 
      importantly, an informed employment of this substance for therapeutic purposes.

TI  - Diving, cannabis use, and techniques of neutralisation: exploring how divers 
      rationalise cannabis use.
PG  - 88-94
LID - 10.5603/IMH.2019.0014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diving medicine literature often regards the use of cannabis as a 
      potential contra-indicator for fitness to dive. With that said, there has been no 
      empirical research done with cannabis-using divers to examine how they subjectively 
      understand and construct the risks that their cannabis use may have on their diving. 
      This study explored how cannabis-using divers rationalise the pejorative 
      associations of cannabis use through rhetorical techniques of neutralisation (TON) 
      that function to deny the risks that cannabis use may have on their diving. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten medically-fit professional divers from South Africa were 
      individually intervie- wed. The interviews focussed on each diver's reported 
      recreational use of cannabis. The interviews were transcribed and analysed through a 
      framework for TON originally formulated by Sykes and Matza (1957). RESULTS: Analysis 
      revealed six primary TON employed to refute the pejorative associations of cannabis 
      use on dive work, namely: 1. Denial of responsibility: which denies a diver's direct 
      culpability for their cannabis use; 2. Denial of injury: which asserts that no 
      (serious) harm results from a diver's cannabis use; 3. Denial of victim: which 
      repudiates the potentially deleterious effects that cannabis use may have on a 
      diver; 4. Condemnation of condemners: which minimises cannabis use in relation to 
      other divers' unsafe diving practices; 5. Appeal to loyalties: which situates 
      cannabis use within interpersonal networks to whom a diver has a "higher" 
      allegiance; 6. Denial of penalty: which justifies cannabis use by virtue of a 
      perceived lack of punitive action by a Diving Medical Examiner. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      findings of this research highlight the TON which potentially inform a diver's 
      cannabis use, particularly in relation to their diving. Identifying such TON carry 
      important implications for the ways in which fitness to dive is assessed.

TI  - The impact of cannabis use on male sexual function: A 10-year, single-center 
      experience.
PG  - E652-E657
LID - 10.5489/cuaj.7185 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite increasing consumption rates in much of the world, the impact 
      of cannabis use on various components of male sexual function remains poorly 
      established. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the relationship 
      between cannabis use and reproductive and sexual function using a large patient 
      cohort from a single academic andrology clinic. METHODS: This is a historical cohort 
      study from a single academic center andrology clinic. Patients from 2008-2017 were 
      included. Intake questionnaires provided baseline demographic information, as well 
      as data regarding substance use and various sexual function parameters. Subjects 
      were categorized as cannabis users or non-users. Cannabis users and non-users were 
      compared using descriptive statistics and Chi-squared tests, and regression analyses 
      were performed to test for association. RESULTS: A total of 7809 males were included 
      in the study; 993 (12.7%) were cannabis users and 6816 (87.3%) were non-users. 
      Cannabis users had a higher mean Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score 
      (21.9±4.4 vs. 21.2±4.8, p<0.001) and mean serum total testosterone (13.4±12.0 nmol/L 
      vs. 12.6±11.8 nmol/L, p=0.04) than non-users, although they also had a higher rate 
      of positive Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM) scores (52% vs. 46%, 
      p<0.001). Cannabis users also reported higher sexual frequency compared to non-users 
      (8.8 events/month vs. 7.8 events/month, p<0.05). On multivariate analysis, cannabis 
      use was not associated with SHIM score or serum testosterone concentration. Cannabis 
      use was associated with positive ADAM scores. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use was not 
      associated with clinically significant deleterious effects on male sexual parameters 
      in this cohort.

TI  - Bioactive Chemical Composition of Cannabis Extracts and Cannabinoid Receptors.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25153466 [doi]
LID - 3466
AB  - Cannabis is widely used as a therapeutic drug, especially by patients suffering from 
      psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the complex interplay between 
      phytocannabinoids and their targets in the human receptome remains largely a 
      mystery, and there have been few investigations into the relationship between the 
      chemical composition of medical cannabis and the corresponding biological activity. 
      In this study, we investigated 59 cannabis samples used by patients for medical 
      reasons. The samples were subjected to extraction (microwave and supercritical 
      carbon dioxide) and chemical analyses, and the resulting extracts were assayed in 
      vitro using the CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. Using a partial least squares regression 
      analysis, the chemical compositions of the extracts were then correlated to their 
      corresponding cannabinoid receptor activities, thus generating predictive models 
      that describe the receptor potency as a function of major phytocannabinoid content. 
      Using the current dataset, meaningful models for CB(1) and CB(2) receptor agonism 
      were obtained, and these reveal the insignificant relationships between the major 
      phytocannabinoid content and receptor affinity for CB(1) but good correlations 
      between the two at CB(2) receptors. These results also explain the anomalies between 
      the receptor activities of pure phytocannabinoids and cannabis extracts. 
      Furthermore, the models for CB(1) and CB(2) agonism in cannabis extracts predict the 
      cannabinoid receptor activities of individual phytocannabinoids with reasonable 
      accuracy. Here for the first time, we disclose a method to predict the relationship 
      between the chemical composition, including phytocannabinoids, of cannabis extracts 
      and cannabinoid receptor responses.

TI  - The Impact of THC and CBD in Schizophrenia: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 694394

AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia are more likely to develop cannabis use 
      disorder (CUD) and experience worse outcomes with use. Yet as cannabis is legalized 
      for medical and recreational use, there is interest in its therapeutic potential. 
      Objectives: To conduct a systematic review summarizing the design and results of 
      controlled trials using defined doses of THC and CBD in schizophrenia. Method: A 
      keyword search of eight online literature databases identified 11 eligible reports. 
      Results: One placebo controlled trial (13 stable patients without CUD) found that 
      intravenous THC increased psychosis and worsened learning/recall. Two reports of a 
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study of smoked or oral THC in 12 abstinent 
      patients with schizophrenia and CUD found no change in symptoms and cognition, and 
      an amelioration of impaired resting state brain function in areas implicated in 
      reward function and the default mode network. One 4 week trial in acutely psychotic 
      inpatients without CUD (mean age 30 y) found 800 mg CBD to be similarly efficacious 
      to amisupride in improving psychosis and cognition. Two 6 week studies of CBD 
      augmentation of antipsychotics in stable outpatients reported mixed results: CBD 600 
      mg was not more effective than placebo; CBD 1,000 mg reduced symptoms in a sample 
      that did not exclude cannabis use and CUD. A brain fMRI and proton magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy study of single dose CBD in a sample that did not exclude CUD 
      and cannabis use found that CBD improved symptoms and brain function during a 
      learning/recall task and was associated with increased hippocampal glutamate. 
      Discussion: There is substantial heterogeneity across studies in dose, method of 
      drug delivery, length of treatment, patient age, whether patients with cannabis 
      use/CUD were included or excluded, and whether patients were using antipsychotic 
      medication. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence for an effect of THC or CBD 
      on symptoms, cognition, and neuroimaging measures of brain function in 
      schizophrenia. At this time, research does not support recommending medical cannabis 
      (THC or CBD) for treating patients with schizophrenia. Further research should 
      examine THC and CBD in schizophrenia with and without comorbid CUD and consider the 
      role of CBD in mitigating symptom exacerbation from THC.

TI  - Changes in Cannabis Consumption During the Global COVID-19 Lockdown: The 
      International COVISTRESS Study.
PG  - 689634
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.689634 [doi]

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 lockdown measures have been sources of both potential stress 
      and possible psychological and addiction complications. A lack of activity and 
      isolation during lockdown are among the factors thought to be behind the growth in 
      the use of psychoactive substances and worsening addictive behaviors. Previous 
      studies on the pandemic have attested to an increase in alcohol consumption during 
      lockdowns. Likewise, data suggest there has also been a rise in the use of cannabis, 
      although it is unclear how this is affected by external factors. Our study used 
      quantitative data collected from an international population to evaluate changes in 
      cannabis consumption during the lockdown period between March and October, 2020. We 
      also compared users and non-users of the drug in relation to: (1) socio-demographic 
      differences, (2) emotional experiences, and (3) the information available and the 
      degree of approval of lockdown measures. Methods: An online self-report 
      questionnaire concerning the lockdown was widely disseminated around the globe. Data 
      was collected on sociodemographics and how the rules imposed had influenced the use 
      of cannabis and concerns about health, the economic impact of the measures and the 
      approach taken by government(s). Results: One hundred eighty two respondents 
      consumed cannabis before the lockdown vs. 199 thereafter. The mean cannabis 
      consumption fell from 13 joints per week pre-lockdown to 9.75 after it (p < 0.001). 
      Forty-nine respondents stopped using cannabis at all and 66 admitted to starting to 
      do so. The cannabis users were: less satisfied with government measures; less 
      worried about their health; more concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on the 
      economy and their career; and more frightened of becoming infected in public areas. 
      The risk factors for cannabis use were: age (OR = 0.96); concern for physical health 
      (OR = 0.98); tobacco (OR = 1.1) and alcohol consumption during lockdown (OR = 1.1); 
      the pre-lockdown anger level (OR = 1.01); and feelings of boredom during the 
      restrictions (OR = 1.1). Conclusion: In a specific sub-population, the COVID-19 
      lockdown brought about either an end to the consumption of cannabis or new use of 
      the drug. The main risk factors for cannabis use were: a lower age, co-addictions 
      and high levels of emotions.

AB  - Data from a large network of community health centers connected via a single 
      electronic health record (EHR) system examined associations between psychiatric 
      disorders and documentation of a cannabis-related disorder among patients with 
      reported cannabis use. Participants were adults who had at least one ambulatory 
      visit at a clinic in three states between 1/1/2012 and 12/31/2016 and had either 1) 
      a documented cannabis-related disorder indicated by an ICD-9/10 code on the problem 
      list or encounter list or 2) documentation of cannabis use in the EHR social history 
      section. Clinics included 101,405 patients with either cannabis use recorded in the 
      social history of the EHR (n = 71,660) or a cannabis-related disorder documented in 
      the encounter or problem list (n = 29,745). GEE logistic regression modeling 
      estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Odds of patients having cannabis-related 
      disorder recorded on the encounter or problem list were higher for individuals with 
      depression (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13), anxiety (aOR = 1.16, CI: 1.11-1.21) and 
      bipolar disorder (aOR = 1.16, CI: 1.10-1.23). A diagnosis of schizophrenia increased 
      the odds of a cannabis-related disorder by 62% (aOR = 1.62, CI: 1.48- 1.78). Primary 
      care providers should routinely screen for and document cannabis-related disorders 
      and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Studies have shown altered task-based brain functioning as a result of cannabis use. 
      To date, however, whether similar alterations in baseline resting state and 
      functional organization of neural activity are observable in cannabis users remains 
      unknown. We characterized global resting state cortical activations and functional 
      connectivity via electroencephalography (EEG) in cannabis users and related these 
      activations to measures of cannabis use. Resting state EEG in the eyes closed 
      condition was collected from age- and sex-matched cannabis users (N = 17; 6 females; 
      mean age = 30.9 ± 7.4 years) and non-using controls (N = 21; 9 females; mean 
      age = 33.1 ± 11.6 years). Power spectral density and spectral coherence were 
      computed to determine differences in cortical activations and connectivity between 
      the two groups in the delta (1-4Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta 
      (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-50 Hz) frequency bands. Cannabis users exhibited decreased 
      delta and increased theta, beta, and gamma power compared to controls, suggesting 
      increased cortical activation in resting state and a disinhibition of inhibitory 
      functions that may interrupt cognitive processes. Cannabis users also exhibited 
      increased interhemispheric and intrahemispheric coherence relative to controls, 
      reduced mean network degree, and increased clustering coefficient in specific 
      regions and frequencies. This increased cortical activity may indicate a loss of 
      neural refinement and efficiency that may indicate a "noisy" brain. Lastly, measures 
      related to cannabis use were correlated with spectral power and functional 
      connectivity measures, indicating that specific electrophysiological signals are 
      associated with cannabis use. These results suggest that there are differences in 
      cortical activity and connectivity between cannabis users and non-using controls in 
      the resting state that may be related to putative cognitive impairments and can 
      inform effectiveness of intervention programs.

AB  - Concomitant cannabis and nicotine use is more prevalent than cannabis use alone; 
      however, to date, most of the literature has focused on associations of isolated 
      cannabis and nicotine use limiting the generalizability of existing research. To 
      determine differential associations of concomitant use of cannabis and nicotine, 
      isolated cannabis use and isolated nicotine use on brain network connectivity, we 
      examined systems-level neural functioning via independent components analysis (ICA) 
      on resting state networks (RSNs) in cannabis users (CAN, n = 53), nicotine users 
      (NIC, n = 28), concomitant nicotine and cannabis users (NIC + CAN, n = 26), and 
      non-users (CTRL, n = 30). Our results indicated that the CTRL group and NIC + CAN 
      users had the greatest functional connectivity relative to CAN users and NIC users 
      in 12 RSNs: anterior default mode network (DMN), posterior DMN, left frontal 
      parietal network, lingual gyrus, salience network, right frontal parietal network, 
      higher visual network, insular cortex, cuneus/precuneus, posterior cingulate 
      gyrus/middle temporal gyrus, dorsal attention network, and basal ganglia network. 
      Post hoc tests showed no significant differences between (1) CTRL and NIC + CAN and 
      (2) NIC and CAN users. These findings of differential associations of isolated vs. 
      combined nicotine and cannabis use demonstrate an interaction between cannabis and 
      nicotine use on RSNs. These unique and combined mechanisms through which cannabis 
      and nicotine influence cortical network functional connectivity are important to 
      consider when evaluating the neurobiological pathways associated with cannabis and 
      nicotine use.

TI  - Association Between Self-reported Prenatal Cannabis Use and Maternal, Perinatal, and 
      Neonatal Outcomes.
PG  - 145-152

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Recent evidence suggests that cannabis use during pregnancy is 
      increasing, although population-based data about perinatal outcomes following in 
      utero exposure remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether there are associations 
      between self-reported prenatal cannabis use and adverse maternal and perinatal 
      outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based retrospective cohort 
      study covering live births and stillbirths among women aged 15 years and older in 
      Ontario, Canada, between April 2012 and December 2017. EXPOSURES: Self-reported 
      cannabis exposure in pregnancy was ascertained through routine perinatal care. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was preterm birth before 37 weeks' 
      gestation. Indicators were defined for birth occurring at 34 to 36 6/7 weeks' 
      gestation (late preterm), 32 to 33 6/7 weeks' gestation, 28 to 31 6/7 weeks' 
      gestation, and less than 28 weeks' gestation (very preterm birth). Ten secondary 
      outcomes were examined including small for gestational age, placental abruption, 
      transfer to neonatal intensive care, and 5-minute Apgar score. Coarsened exact 
      matching techniques and Poisson regression models were used to estimate the risk 
      difference (RD) and relative risk (RR) of outcomes associated with cannabis exposure 
      and control for confounding. RESULTS: In a cohort of 661 617 women, the mean 
      gestational age was 39.3 weeks and 51% of infants were male. Mothers had a mean age 
      of 30.4 years and 9427 (1.4%) reported cannabis use during pregnancy. Imbalance in 
      measured maternal obstetrical and sociodemographic characteristics between reported 
      cannabis users and nonusers was attenuated using matching, yielding a sample of 5639 
      reported users and 92 873 nonusers. The crude rate of preterm birth less than 37 
      weeks' gestation was 6.1% among women who did not report cannabis use and 12.0% 
      among those reporting use in the unmatched cohort (RD, 5.88% [95% CI, 5.22%-6.54%]). 
      In the matched cohort, reported cannabis exposure was significantly associated with 
      an RD of 2.98% (95% CI, 2.63%-3.34%) and an RR of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.36-1.47) for 
      preterm birth. Compared with no reported use, cannabis exposure was significantly 
      associated with greater frequency of small for gestational age (third percentile, 
      6.1% vs 4.0%; RR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.45-1.61]), placental abruption (1.6% vs 0.9%; RR, 
      1.72 [95% CI, 1.54-1.92]), transfer to neonatal intensive care (19.3% vs 13.8%; RR, 
      1.40 [95% CI, 1.36-1.44]), and 5-minute Apgar score less than 4 (1.1% vs 0.9%; RR, 
      1.28 [95% CI, 1.13-1.45]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among pregnant women in 
      Ontario, Canada, reported cannabis use was significantly associated with an 
      increased risk of preterm birth. Findings may be limited by residual confounding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our study aims to evaluate the trends in online information about 
      cannabis and kratom on Facebook in Thailand, where there is current discussion 
      regarding legalizing these drugs. METHODS: Between April and November 2015, 
      reviewers searched for cannabis and kratom Facebook pages in the Thai language via 
      the common search engines. Content analysis was performed and the contents of each 
      page were categorized by the tone of the post (positive, negative or neutral). Then, 
      a one-year follow-up search was conducted to compare the contents. RESULTS: Twelve 
      Facebook pages each were initially identified for cannabis and for kratom. Follower 
      numbers were higher for cannabis pages. Kratom pages were less active but were open 
      for a longer time. Posts with positive tones and neutral tones were found for both 
      drugs, but none had negative tones. Other drugs were mentioned on the cannabis 
      pages, but they were different from those mentioned on the kratom pages. Issues 
      regarding drug legalization were found on the cannabis pages but not on the kratom 
      pages during the searching period. One year later, the tone of the posts was in the 
      same direction, but the page activity had increased. CONCLUSIONS: The information 
      currently available on the sampled Facebook pages was positive towards the use of 
      cannabis and kratom. No information about harm from these drugs was found through 
      our search.

TI  - Marijuana Use in the Era of Changing Cannabis Laws: What Are the Risks? Who is Most 
      at Risk?
PG  - 398-404
AB  - We review recent findings on medical aspects of marijuana use in order to identify 
      those who are at greatest risk of marijuana-related medical problems. We analyze the 
      impact of medical marijuana laws on health, in particular the disproportionate 
      effects on adolescents and children. Chronic marijuana use predominantly affects 
      certain areas of the brain that overlap the default mode network, linked hubs in the 
      brain that play a supervisory role in critical thought processes such as attention, 
      memory, and social interactions. Disruption of the default mode network areas has 
      been documented in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, illnesses with symptoms 
      and brain changes that parallel findings in marijuana abusers. These findings 
      counter the claim that marijuana is a harmless drug and are a cause for alarm in 
      persons with cannabis dependence.

TI  - Expression of Putative Defense Responses in Cannabis Primed by Pseudomonas and/or 
      Bacillus Strains and Infected by Botrytis cinerea.
PG  - 572112

LID - 572112
AB  - Cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) offers many industrial, agricultural, and medicinal 
      applications, but is commonly threatened by the gray mold disease caused by the 
      fungus Botrytis cinerea. With few effective control measures currently available, 
      the use of beneficial rhizobacteria represents a promising biocontrol avenue for 
      cannabis. To counter disease development, plants rely on a complex network of 
      inducible defense pathways, allowing them to respond locally and systemically to 
      pathogens attacks. In this study, we present the first attempt to control gray mold 
      in cannabis using beneficial rhizobacteria, and the first investigation of cannabis 
      defense responses at the molecular level. Four promising Pseudomonas (LBUM223 and 
      WCS417r) and Bacillus strains (LBUM279 and LBUM979) were applied as single or 
      combined root treatments to cannabis seedlings, which were subsequently infected by 
      B. cinerea. Symptoms were recorded and the expression of eight putative defense 
      genes was monitored in leaves by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction. The rhizobacteria did not significantly control gray mold and all infected 
      leaves were necrotic after a week, regardless of the treatment. Similarly, no 
      systemic activation of putative cannabis defense genes was reported, neither 
      triggered by the pathogen nor by the rhizobacteria. However, this work identified 
      five putative defense genes (ERF1, HEL, PAL, PR1, and PR2) that were strongly and 
      sustainably induced locally at B. cinerea's infection sites, as well as two stably 
      expressed reference genes (TIP41 and APT1) in cannabis. These markers will be useful 
      in future researches exploring cannabis defense pathways.

TI  - An Exploration of e-Cigarette-Related Search Items on YouTube: Network Analysis.
PG  - e30679
LID - 10.2196/30679 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: e-Cigarette use among youth is high, which may be due in part to 
      pro-e-cigarette content on social media such as YouTube. YouTube is also a valuable 
      resource for learning about e-cigarette use, trends, marketing, and e-cigarette user 
      perceptions. However, there is a lack of understanding on how similar 
      e-cigarette-related search items result in similar or relatively mutually exclusive 
      search results. This study uses novel methods to evaluate the relationship between 
      e-cigarette-related search items and results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to 
      apply network modeling and rule-based classification to characterize the 
      relationships between e-cigarette-related search items on YouTube and gauge the 
      level of importance of each search item as part of an e-cigarette information 
      network on YouTube. METHODS: We used 16 fictitious YouTube profiles to retrieve 4201 
      distinct videos from 18 keywords related to e-cigarettes. We used network modeling 
      to represent the relationships between the search items. Moreover, we developed a 
      rule-based classification approach to classify videos. We used betweenness 
      centrality (BC) and correlations between nodes (ie, search items) to help us gain 
      knowledge of the underlying structure of the information network. RESULTS: By 
      modeling search items and videos as a network, we observed that broad search items 
      such as e-cig had the most connections to other search items, and specific search 
      items such as cigalike had the least connections. Search items with similar words 
      (eg, vape and vaping) and search items with similar meaning (eg, e-liquid and 
      e-juice) yielded a high degree of connectedness. We also found that each node had 18 
      (SD 34.8) connections (common videos) on average. BC indicated that general search 
      items such as electronic cigarette and vaping had high importance in the network 
      (BC=0.00836). Our rule-based classification sorted videos into four categories: 
      e-cigarette devices (34%-57%), cannabis vaping (16%-28%), e-liquid (14%-37%), and 
      other (8%-22%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that search items on YouTube have 
      unique relationships that vary in strength and importance. Our methods can not only 
      be used to successfully identify the important, overlapping, and unique 
      e-cigarette-related search items but also help determine which search items are more 
      likely to act as a gateway to e-cigarette-related content.

TI  - Medical Cannabis Use Among Older Adults in Canada: Self-Reported Data on Types and 
      Amount Used, and Perceived Effects.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1007/s40266-021-00913-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical cannabis use is growing among older adults. In this 
      retrospective study, we aimed to assess the characteristics of older medical 
      cannabis users including the indications, type and amount of cannabis used, 
      perceived changes in symptoms after cannabis use, change in dose of concurrent 
      medications, and adverse effects. METHODS: Data were collected between October 2014 
      and October 2020 from patients who were consulting the Canada-wide network of 
      clinics of a medical cannabis provider and who were willing to answer questionnaires 
      based on their medical status. The current study included older adults (≥ 65 years) 
      who completed questionnaires at intake and first follow-up visits. Data were 
      summarized with descriptive statistics, which were compared between men and women 
      with t tests or chi-squared tests. Tests of proportions assessed categorical 
      responses for perceived effects after cannabis use. Logistic regression was used to 
      assess trends in cannabis usage. RESULTS: Data included that from 9766 older adult 
      users at intake (mean ± SD age = 73.2 ± 6.8 years, females = 60.0%), among whom 4673 
      (females = 61.4%) returned for follow-up after 90.6 ± 58 days. The most common 
      primary indication for which medical cannabis was sought was pain (67.7%), which was 
      more common in women, whereas oncological and neurological conditions were more 
      common in men. At follow-up, cannabis oil was used by 81.0% of older adults, among 
      whom compositions containing only or mostly cannabidiol (CBD) had been used by 
      83.6%. Adverse effects reported by older adults at the follow-up visit included dry 
      mouth (12.8%), drowsiness (8.6%), and dizziness (4.0%). The majority of older adults 
      reported improvements in pain (72.7%, z = 1482.6, p < 0.0001, compared to worsening 
      or no change), sleep (64.5%, z = 549.4, p < 0.0001), and mood (52.8%, z = 16.4, p < 
      0.0001), with 35.6% reporting use of a reduced dose of opioids and 19.9% a reduced 
      dose of benzodiazepines. INTERPRETATION: Among older adults, medical cannabis is 
      used more often by women, with CBD-containing cannabis oils being the most commonly 
      used. Users reported improved pain, sleep, and mood symptoms at follow-up after 
      cannabis use. This study describes the patterns of use of medical cannabis by older 
      adults and highlights the need for research to determine appropriate indications, 
      precise doses of active ingredients, and short- and long-term outcomes among older 
      adults.

TI  - Endocannabinoid-Mediated Neuromodulation in the Olfactory Bulb: Functional and 
      Therapeutic Significance.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21082850 [doi]
LID - 2850
AB  - Endocannabinoid synthesis in the human body is naturally occurring and on-demand. It 
      occurs in response to physiological and environmental stimuli, such as stress, 
      anxiety, hunger, other factors negatively disrupting homeostasis, as well as the 
      therapeutic use of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol and recreational use of 
      exogenous cannabis, which can lead to cannabis use disorder. Together with their 
      specific receptors CB1R and CB2R, endocannabinoids are major components of 
      endocannabinoid-mediated neuromodulation in a rapid and sustained manner. Extensive 
      research on endocannabinoid function and expression includes studies in limbic 
      system structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala. The wide distribution of 
      endocannabinoids, their on-demand synthesis at widely different sites, their 
      co-existence in specific regions of the body, their quantitative differences in 
      tissue type, and different pathological conditions indicate their diverse biological 
      functions that utilize specific and overlapping pathways in multiple organ systems. 
      Here, we review emerging evidence of these pathways with a special emphasis on the 
      role of endocannabinoids in decelerating neurodegenerative pathology through neural 
      networks initiated by cells in the main olfactory bulb.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Comorbid Major Depressive Disorder 
      and Alcohol Use Disorder.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12010048 [doi]
LID - 48
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are leading causes of 
      disability, and patients are frequently affected by both conditions. This 
      comorbidity is known to confer worse outcomes and greater illness severity. 
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive 
      neuromodulation method that has demonstrated antidepressant effects. However, the 
      study of rTMS for patients with MDD and commonly associated comorbidities, such as 
      AUD, has been largely overlooked, despite significant overlap in clinical 
      presentation and neurobiological mechanisms. This narrative review aims to highlight 
      the interrelated aspects of the literature on rTMS for MDD and rTMS for AUD. First, 
      we summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of rTMS for each condition, 
      both most studied through stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). 
      Second, we describe common symptom constructs that can be modulated by rTMS, such as 
      executive dysfunction, that are transdiagnostic across these disorders. Lastly, we 
      describe promising approaches in the personalization and optimization of rTMS that 
      may be applicable to both AUD and MDD. By bridging the gap between research efforts 
      in MDD and AUD, rTMS is well positioned to be developed as a treatment for the many 
      patients who have both conditions concurrently.

TI  - Functional connectivity and cannabis use in high-risk adolescents.
PG  - 414-23
LID - 10.3109/00952990.2013.837914 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a unique neurodevelopmental period when regions of the 
      brain most able to assess risk and reward are still in development. Cannabis use 
      during adolescence has been associated with persistent negative outcomes. Although 
      measures of resting brain activity are useful in assessing functional connectivity, 
      such measures have not been broadly applied in adolescent cannabis-users. 
      OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study was to analyze the associations between 
      cannabis use and resting brain activity in a sample of high-risk adolescents. 
      METHODS: Eighty-two high-risk youth between 14-18 years old were recruited from a 
      juvenile justice day program. Youth completed a brief neurocognitive battery 
      including assessments of cannabis use and a 5-minute resting functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Intrinsic connectivity networks were extracted using 
      the GIFT toolbox. Brain activity in a fronto-temporal network was compared in youth 
      with high cannabis use vs. low cannabis use using an independent-samples t-test with 
      alcohol use entered as a covariate. RESULTS: Analysis revealed two elements within 
      the fronto-temporal network related to cannabis use: one in middle frontal gyrus 
      related to high cannabis use, and one in middle temporal gyrus related to low 
      cannabis use. Only the frontal source survived application of a cluster size 
      threshold and was significant at p < 0.005. CONCLUSIONS: These results are 
      consistent with patterns of activity in adult cannabis-users. The observed effect 
      may reflect either pre-existing risk factors or near-term consequences of cannabis 
      use. Prevention and intervention strategies that address fronto-temporal functioning 
      may be particularly helpful in this population.

TI  - Friendship and Consumption Networks in Adolescents and Their Relationship to Stress 
      and Cannabis Use Intention.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18073335 [doi]
LID - 3335
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is an illegal psychoactive substance that's use is widespread 
      among adolescents. During adolescence, many changes can cause stress. In this phase, 
      the group of friends becomes increasingly important, being a situation of 
      vulnerability for the beginning of cannabis use, either as an escape mechanism or 
      due to peer's influence. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe and 
      analyze the structure of the consumption and friendship network, the intention to 
      use cannabis, and the stress in a secondary school class. METHODS: An online 
      platform with validated self-reported questionnaires were used for data collection. 
      RESULTS: The sample consisted of adolescents (n = 20) aged 14-16 from a third-year 
      class of compulsory secondary education in Ponferrada (León, Spain). Significant 
      differences were obtained concerning consumption intention and the different network 
      metrics in both the friendship and consumption networks. Subsequently, the 
      representation of these networks was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Social Network 
      Analysis is a very useful tool that provides a picture of the context in which 
      adolescents are located. In the consumption network, there are central actors who 
      have not yet consumed cannabis; this is a crucial moment to implement prevention 
      strategies.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are mental diseases caused by a 
      combination of genetic susceptibility and a number of environmental factors. Among 
      these factors, the role of traumatic events suffered in childhood, as well as that 
      of substance use, have been of particular research interest. Objectives: To conduct 
      a systematic review to clarify whether there is an interaction between childhood 
      trauma and substance use related to the diagnosis or symptoms of SSD. It was also 
      the objective of this review to collate the associations that may exist between the 
      three variables of the study (trauma, substance use and psychosis). Methods: We 
      conducted a systematic search resulting in 240 articles. We considered all of the 
      original articles that explored childhood trauma and substance use in patients 
      suffering from SSD. Results: Twenty-three articles were selected for this review. 
      Several of the reviewed papers found associations between childhood trauma and 
      substance use with SSD, as well as interactions between trauma and drug use on SSD. 
      Conclusions: The results suggest that childhood trauma and substance use may be 
      present at the basis of psychosis. This double hit on the pathogenesis could have 
      clinical implications, since each of these impacts could be considered a window of 
      opportunity for the primary prevention of SSD.

TI  - Polish Physicians' Perspectives on Medical Cannabis Policy and Educational Needs: 
      Results of An Online Survey.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10194545 [doi]
LID - 4545
AB  - (1) Background: In November 2017, medical cannabis was legalized in Poland. Until 
      now, there have been no studies conducted to examine the perspectives of Polish 
      physicians about their preferences regarding medical cannabis legal status and 
      educational needs. (2) Methods: The survey was a self-developed online questionnaire 
      with 57 participants. Participation was voluntary. The link was shared through a 
      personal network of medical doctors, regional medical chambers, and with doctors 
      attending palliative care courses organized by our research group. Results: Between 
      June and October 2020, 173 HCPs from Poland completed the survey. More than half of 
      the study participants never received any education on medical cannabis (60.1%); 
      71.1% declared their knowledge was insufficient to counsel patients about medical 
      cannabis use. The majority claimed that they would like to be able to answer patient 
      questions (92.4%); 93.1% declared a need to create clear guidelines for using 
      cannabinoids in clinical practice. Furthermore, 71.7% believed that medicines 
      containing cannabinoids and 52.0% that herbal cannabis should be reimbursed (3). 
      Conclusion: Most medical doctors do not feel prepared for patient counseling. They 
      could benefit from targeted educational interventions. We have also identified 
      physicians' preferences that might inspire the stakeholders involved who are 
      critical for shaping policies regarding cannabis-based therapeutics.

TI  - Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines: Potential Links between the Endocannabinoid System and 
      the Kynurenine Pathway in Depression.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22115903 [doi]
LID - 5903
AB  - Substance use/abuse is one of the main causes of depressive symptoms. Cannabis and 
      synthetic cannabinoids in particular gained significant popularity in the past 
      years. There is an increasing amount of clinical data associating such compounds 
      with the inflammatory component of depression, indicated by the up-regulation of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are also well-known to 
      regulate the enzymes of the kynurenine pathway (KP), which is responsible for 
      metabolizing tryptophan, a precursor in serotonin synthesis. Enhanced 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine levels may over-activate the KP, leading to tryptophan 
      depletion and reduced serotonin levels, which can subsequently precipitate 
      depressive symptoms. Therefore, such mechanism might represent a possible link 
      between the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and the KP in depression, via the 
      inflammatory and dysregulated serotonergic component of the disorder. This review 
      will summarize the data regarding those natural and synthetic cannabinoids that 
      increase pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the data on such cytokines 
      associated with KP activation will be further reviewed accordingly. The interaction 
      of the ECS and the KP has been postulated and demonstrated in some studies 
      previously. This review will further contribute to this yet less explored connection 
      and propose the KP to be the missing link between cannabinoid-induced inflammation 
      and depressive symptoms.

AB  - Adolescent drug misuse represents a major risk factor for long-term drug use 
      disorders. However, wide individual differences in responses to first-line 
      behavioral therapies targeting adolescent drug misuse limit critical early 
      intervention. Identifying the neural signatures of those adolescents most likely to 
      respond to an intervention would potentially guide personalized strategies for 
      reducing drug misuse. Prior to a 14-week evidence-based intervention involving 
      combinations of contingency management, motivational enhancement, and cognitive 
      behavioral therapy, thirty adolescent alcohol and/or cannabis users underwent fMRI 
      while performing a reward delay discounting (DD) task tapping an addiction-related 
      cognition. Intervention responses were longitudinally characterized by both 
      urinalysis and self-report measures of the percentage of days used during treatment 
      and in post-treatment follow-up. Group independent component analysis (ICA) of task 
      fMRI data identified neural processing networks related to DD task performance. 
      Separate measures of wholesale recruitment during immediate reward choices and 
      within-network functional connectivity among selective networks significantly 
      predicted intervention-related changes in drug misuse frequency. Specifically, 
      heightened pre-intervention engagement of a temporal lobe "reward motivation" 
      network for impulsive choices on the DD task predicted poorer intervention outcomes, 
      while modes of functional connectivity within the reward motivation network, a 
      prospection network, and a posterior insula network demonstrated robust associations 
      with intervention outcomes. Finally, the pre-intervention functional organization of 
      the prospection network also predicted post-intervention drug use behaviors for up 
      to 6 months of follow-up. Multiple functional variations in the neural processing 
      networks supporting preference for immediate and future rewards signal individual 
      differences in readiness to benefit from an effective behavioral therapy for 
      reducing adolescent drug misuse. The implications for efforts to boost therapy 
      responses are discussed.

TI  - Cannabis Use Disorder and Perioperative Outcomes in Major Elective Surgeries: A 
      Retrospective Cohort Analysis.
PG  - 625-635
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000003067 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although cannabis is known to have cardiovascular and psychoactive 
      effects, the implications of its use before surgery are currently unknown. The 
      objective of the present study was to determine whether patients with an active 
      cannabis use disorder have an elevated risk of postoperative complications. METHODS: 
      The authors conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients 
      undergoing elective surgery in the United States using the Nationwide Inpatient 
      Sample from 2006 to 2015. A sample of 4,186,622 inpatients 18 to 65 yr of age 
      presenting for 1 of 11 elective surgeries including total knee replacement, total 
      hip replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, caesarian section, cholecystectomy, 
      colectomy, hysterectomy, breast surgery, hernia repair, laminectomy, and other spine 
      surgeries was selected. The principal exposure was an active cannabis use disorder, 
      as defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical 
      Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes for cannabis dependence and cannabis abuse. 
      The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital postoperative myocardial 
      infarction, stroke, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, acute kidney 
      injury requiring dialysis, respiratory failure, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary 
      outcomes included hospital length of stay, total hospital costs, and the individual 
      components of the composite endpoint. RESULTS: The propensity-score matched-pairs 
      cohort consisted of 27,206 patients. There was no statistically significant 
      difference between patients with (400 of 13,603; 2.9%) and without (415 of 13,603; 
      3.1%) a reported active cannabis use disorder with regard to the composite 
      perioperative outcome (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.42; P < 
      0.001; Adjusted odds ratio = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.11; P = 0.63). However, the 
      adjusted odds of postoperative myocardial infarction was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.31 to 2.69; 
      P < 0.001) times higher for patients with a reported active cannabis use disorder 
      (89 of 13,603; 0.7%) compared with those without (46 of 13,603; 0.3%) an active 
      cannabis use disorder (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.88; 95% CI, 2.34 to 3.55; P < 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An active cannabis use disorder is associated with an increased 
      perioperative risk of myocardial infarction.

TI  - Cannabis Consumption in People Living with HIV: Reasons for Use, Secondary Effects, 
      and Opportunities for Health Education.
PG  - 204-213
LID - 10.1089/can.2018.0068 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Rates of cannabis consumption range from 40% to 74% among people 
      living with HIV (PLWH). Little is known about the reasons for cannabis use, related 
      modes of administration, effectiveness for symptom relief, or undesirable effects in 
      the modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. Our aim was to conduct an exploratory 
      study to identify potential areas for further evaluation and intervention. Materials 
      and Methods: From January to June 2018, health care providers at the Chronic Viral 
      Illness Service in Montreal, Canada, asked their patients about cannabis use during 
      routine visits. Patients reporting cannabis use were invited to complete a 20-min 
      coordinator-administered questionnaire. Questions related to patterns of use, modes 
      of administration, reasons for use, secondary effects, and HIV health-related 
      factors (e.g., adherence to ART). Results: One hundred and four PLWH reporting 
      cannabis use participated. Median age was 54 years (interquartile range [IQR] 
      46-59), 13% were female, and 42% were HIV-Hepatitis C co-infected. Median CD4 count 
      was 590 cells/mm(3) (IQR 390-821), 95% of participants were on ART, and 88% had 
      suppressed viral loads. Reported cannabis use was more than once daily (32%); daily 
      (25%); weekly (22%); monthly (17%); and rarely (twice to thrice per year; 6%). The 
      majority of participants (97%) smoked dry plant cannabis. Other modes included 
      vaping (12%), capsules (2%), edibles (21%), and oils (12%). Common reasons for 
      cannabis use were for pleasure (68%) and to reduce anxiety (57%), stress (55%), and 
      pain (57%). Many participants found cannabis "quite effective" or "extremely 
      effective" (45%) for symptom relief. Secondary effects included feeling high (74%), 
      increased cough (45%), paranoia (22%), palpitations (20%), and increased anxiety 
      (21%). Over two-thirds of participants indicated that secondary effects were not 
      bothersome at all. Most participants (68%) rarely missed doses of their ART, while 
      27% missed occasionally (once to twice per month). The most commonly accessed 
      sources of information about cannabis were friends (77%) and the internet (55%). 
      Conclusion: The most common reasons for cannabis use in our population were for 
      pleasure, followed by reduction of stress/anxiety and symptoms associated with a 
      medical condition. Most smoke cannabis and rate cannabis as quite effective for 
      symptom relief. While many participants experience secondary effects, most are not 
      bothered by these symptoms. Amid widespread changes in the regulatory landscape of 
      recreational cannabis, health care providers should be prepared to answer questions 
      about cannabis.

TI  - Trends and Correlates of Cannabis-involved Emergency Department Visits: 2004 to 
      2011.
PG  - 429-436
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine trends and correlates of cannabis-involved emergency 
      department (ED) visits in the United States from 2004 to 2011. METHODS: Data were 
      obtained from the 2004 to 2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network. We analyzed trend in 
      cannabis-involved ED visits for persons aged ≥12 years and stratified by type of 
      cannabis involvement (cannabis-only, cannabis-polydrug). We used logistic 
      regressions to determine correlates of cannabis-involved hospitalization versus 
      cannabis-involved ED visits only. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2011, the ED visit rate 
      increased from 51 to 73 visits per 100,000 population aged ≥12 years for 
      cannabis-only use (P value for trend = 0.004) and from 63 to 100 for 
      cannabis-polydrug use (P value for trend < 0.001). Adolescents aged 12-17 years 
      showed the largest increase in the cannabis-only-involved ED visit rate (rate 
      difference = 80 per 100,000 adolescents). Across racial/ethnic groups, the most 
      prevalent ED visits were noted among non-Hispanic blacks. Among cannabis-involved 
      visits, the odds of hospitalization (vs ED visits only) increased with age strata 
      compared with age 12 to 17 years. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a notable 
      increase in the ED visit numbers and rates for both the use of cannabis-only and 
      cannabis-polydrug during the studied period, particularly among young people and 
      non-Hispanic blacks.

AB  - Medical cannabis has been touted as a solution to the US opioid overdose crisis 
      since Bachhuber et al. [M. A. Bachhuber, B. Saloner, C. O. Cunningham, C. L. Barry, 
      JAMA Intern. Med. 174, 1668–1673] found that from 1999 to 2010 states with medical 
      cannabis laws experienced slower increases in opioid analgesic overdose mortality. 
      That research received substantial attention in the scientific literature and 
      popular press and served as a talking point for the cannabis industry and its 
      advocates, despite caveats from the authors and others to exercise caution when 
      using ecological correlations to draw causal, individual-level conclusions. In this 
      study, we used the same methods to extend Bachhuber et al.’s analysis through 2017. 
      Not only did findings from the original analysis not hold over the longer period, 
      but the association between state medical cannabis laws and opioid overdose 
      mortality reversed direction from −21% to +23% and remained positive after 
      accounting for recreational cannabis laws. We also uncovered no evidence that either 
      broader (recreational) or more restrictive (low-tetrahydrocannabinol) cannabis laws 
      were associated with changes in opioid overdose mortality. We find it unlikely that 
      medical cannabis—used by about 2.5% of the US population—has exerted large 
      conflicting effects on opioid overdose mortality. A more plausible interpretation is 
      that this association is spurious. Moreover, if such relationships do exist, they 
      cannot be rigorously discerned with aggregate data. Research into therapeutic 
      potential of cannabis should continue, but the claim that enacting medical cannabis 
      laws will reduce opioid overdose death should be met with skepticism.

TI  - Prevalence and correlates of selling illicit cannabis among people who use drugs in 
      Vancouver, Canada: A ten-year prospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The illicit selling and use of cannabis is prevalent among marginalized 
      people who use illicit drugs (PWUD). Given that participation in illicit drug 
      markets has been previously associated with a range of health and social harms, we 
      sought to examine the predictors of selling cannabis among PWUD in Vancouver, 
      Canada, a setting with a de facto legalized cannabis market, on the eve of the 
      planned implementation of legalized non-medical cannabis including measures to 
      regulate the existing illicit market. METHODS: Multivariable generalized estimating 
      equations (GEE) logistic regression was used to analyze longitudinal factors 
      associated with selling illicit cannabis among three prospective cohorts of PWUD 
      between September 2005 and May 2015. RESULTS: Among the 3258 participants included 
      in this study, 328 (10.1%) reported selling illicit cannabis at baseline, and 46 
      (5.1%) initiated cannabis selling over the study period. In the multivariable 
      analysis of the whole sample, factors significantly associated with selling cannabis 
      included cannabis use (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 4.05), dealing other drugs 
      (AOR = 3.87), being male (AOR = 1.83), experiencing violence (AOR = 1.40), 
      non-medical prescription opioid use (AOR = 1.32), non-custodial involvement in the 
      criminal justice system (AOR = 1.31), being stopped by police (AOR = 1.30), crack 
      use (AOR = 1.25), homelessness (AOR = 1.23), age (AOR = 0.96 per year) and 
      participation in sex work (AOR = 0.67) (all p < 0.05). The subanalyses indicated 
      that dealing drugs other than cannabis, cannabis use, and non-custodial involvement 
      in the criminal justice system were the only factors significantly associated with 
      selling cannabis in all four subgroups. CONCLUSION: These findings support existing 
      evidence indicating that selling illicit cannabis is often a survival-driven 
      strategy to support the basic needs and substance use of some PWUD. Our findings 
      suggest jurisdictions with planned or impending cannabis legalization and regulation 
      should consider the vulnerability of PWUD when seeking to eradicate illicit cannabis 
      markets, for example, in setting criminal penalties for selling cannabis outside of 
      regulatory frameworks.

AB  - The human endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a complex signalling network involved in 
      many key physiological processes. The ECS includes the cannabinoid receptors, the 
      endocannabinoid ligands, and the enzymes related to their synthesis and degradation. 
      Other cannabinoids encompass the phytocannabinoids from Cannabis sativaL.(marijuana) 
      and the synthetic cannabinoids. Alterations in the ECS are associated with different 
      diseases, including inflammatory and immune-mediated disorders such as allergy. 
      Allergy is a global health problem of increasing prevalence with high socio-economic 
      impact. Different studies have convincingly demonstrated that cannabinoids play a 
      role in allergy, but their actual contribution is still controversial. It has been 
      shown that cannabinoids exert anti-inflammatory properties in the airways and the 
      skin of allergic patients. Other studies reported that cannabinoids might exacerbate 
      asthma and atopic dermatitis mainly depending on CB2-mediated signalling pathways. A 
      better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the mode of action of 
      specific cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors on relevant immune cells under 
      different biological contexts might well contribute to the design of novel 
      strategies for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases. Future research in 
      this promising emerging field in the context of allergy is warranted for the 
      upcoming years.

AB  - Despite recent approval of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products for the treatment 
      of childhood epilepsy, some families continue to use artisanal cannabis products as 
      a way to manage seizures in their children. However, such products are typically of 
      unknown composition and quality, and may therefore pose an unpredictable health risk 
      to the child. In the present analysis, 78 samples of cannabis products collected (as 
      part of a previous study) from families of children with epilepsy (average age 8.8 ± 
      4.6 years) were analyzed for heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury), 
      residual solvents (panel of 19 solvents) and pesticides (panel of 57 pesticides). 
      Due to small sample volumes obtained, only a subset of samples was used in each 
      analysis. Results showed that no cannabis sample exceeded the toxicity limits for 
      heavy metals (n = 51 samples tested). Of the 58 cannabis samples tested for residual 
      solvents, 17 (29%) contained concentrations of ethanol or isopropanol above the 
      generally accepted limit of 5000 parts per million. With the volumes consumed, it 
      was thought unlikely that children were consuming hazardous amounts of residual 
      solvents, although this could not be ruled out in every case. Most samples (n = 31 
      samples tested) yielded inconclusive results for the pesticides, although one sample 
      contained concentrations of bifenthrin that were 4.9 times higher than the 
      acceptable limit. Overall, these results highlight the need for improved access to 
      quality-assured cannabis products and the education of doctors, patients, and 
      artisanal manufacturers around the contaminant exposure risk in unregulated cannabis 
      products.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As more states legalize cannabis for medical and recreational use, 
      people increasingly use cannabis to treat medical conditions and associated 
      symptoms. The prevalence and utility of cannabis for cancer-related symptoms may be 
      clarified by examining cannabis use among patients with a common cancer diagnosis. 
      We aimed to determine the prevalence of cannabis use among colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      survivors and its associations with quality of life (QoL) and cancer-related 
      symptomatology. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of patient-reported QoL outcomes 
      and behaviors, including cannabis use, was conducted within the Patient Outcomes To 
      Advance Learning network's (PORTAL) CRC Cohort. The cohort included a 
      population-based sample of healthcare system members ≥18 years old diagnosed with 
      adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum from 2010 through 2016. We assessed the 
      association between cannabis use and QoL using the European Organization for 
      Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 summary score. RESULTS: Of the 1784 
      respondents, 293 (16.4%) reported cannabis use following CRC diagnosis. Current 
      tobacco smokers were more likely to use cannabis compared to former or never tobacco 
      smokers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56 to 4.70). 
      Greater alcohol use (> 4 drinks per month versus ≤4 drinks per month) was associated 
      with cannabis use (aOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.85). There was an association between 
      cannabis use and cancer stage at diagnosis, with stage 3 or 4 CRC patients more 
      likely to use cannabis than stage 1 or 2 CRC patients (aOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.25 to 
      2.25). After adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidities, stage and site of 
      CRC diagnosis, and prescription opioid use, people who used cannabis had 
      significantly lower QoL than people who did not use cannabis (difference of - 6.14, 
      95% CI - 8.07 to - 4.20). CONCLUSION: Among CRC survivors, cannabis use was 
      relatively common, associated with more advanced stages of disease, associated with 
      tobacco and alcohol use, and not associated with better QoL. Clinicians should 
      inquire about cannabis use among their patients and provide evidence-based 
      recommendations for cancer-related symptoms.

AB  - In 2011 a working group of the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome 
      (ESSTS) has developed the first European assessment guidelines for Tourette syndrome 
      (TS). Now, we present an updated version 2.0 of these European clinical guidelines 
      for Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders, part I: assessment. Therefore, the 
      available literature has been thoroughly screened, supplemented with national 
      guidelines across countries and discussions among ESSTS experts. Diagnostic changes 
      between DSM-IV and DSM-5 classifications were taken into account and new information 
      has been added regarding differential diagnoses, with an emphasis on functional 
      movement disorders in both children and adults. Further, recommendations regarding 
      rating scales to evaluate tics, comorbidities, and neuropsychological status are 
      provided. Finally, results from a recently performed survey among ESSTS members on 
      assessment in TS are described. We acknowledge that the Yale Global Tic Severity 
      Scale (YGTSS) is still the gold standard for assessing tics. Recommendations are 
      provided for scales for the assessment of tics and psychiatric comorbidities in 
      patients with TS not only in routine clinical practice, but also in the context of 
      clinical research. Furthermore, assessments supporting the differential diagnosis 
      process are given as well as tests to analyse cognitive abilities, emotional 
      functions and motor skills.

TI  - Genome-wide association meta-analysis of age at first cannabis use.
PG  - 2073-2086
LID - 10.1111/add.14368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cannabis is one of the most commonly used substances among 
      adolescents and young adults. Earlier age at cannabis initiation is linked to 
      adverse life outcomes, including multi-substance use and dependence. This study 
      estimated the heritability of age at first cannabis use and identified associations 
      with genetic variants. METHODS: A twin-based heritability analysis using 8055 twins 
      from three cohorts was performed. We then carried out a genome-wide association 
      meta-analysis of age at first cannabis use in a discovery sample of 24 953 
      individuals from nine European, North American and Australian cohorts, and a 
      replication sample of 3735 individuals. RESULTS: The twin-based heritability for age 
      at first cannabis use was 38% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 19-60%]. Shared and 
      unique environmental factors explained 39% (95% CI = 20-56%) and 22% (95% 
      CI = 16-29%). The genome-wide association meta-analysis identified five single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 16 within the calcium-transporting 
      ATPase gene (ATP2C2) at P < 5E-08. All five SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium 
      (LD) (r(2)  > 0.8), with the strongest association at the intronic variant rs1574587 
      (P = 4.09E-09). Gene-based tests of association identified the ATP2C2 gene on 
      16q24.1 (P = 1.33e-06). Although the five SNPs and ATP2C2 did not replicate, ATP2C2 
      has been associated with cocaine dependence in a previous study. ATP2B2, which is a 
      member of the same calcium signalling pathway, has been associated previously with 
      opioid dependence. SNP-based heritability for age at first cannabis use was 
      non-significant. CONCLUSION: Age at cannabis initiation appears to be moderately 
      heritable in western countries, and individual differences in onset can be explained 
      by separate but correlated genetic liabilities. The significant association between 
      age of initiation and ATP2C2 is consistent with the role of calcium signalling 
      mechanisms in substance use disorders.

TI  - Medical Cannabis Used as an Alternative Treatment for Chronic Pain Demonstrates 
      Reduction in Chronic Opioid Use - A Prospective Study.
PG  - E113-E119
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic opioid therapy (COT) has been used to treat many chronic pain 
      conditions even with poor evidence for its long-term effectiveness. Medical cannabis 
      has emerged with certain pain-relieving properties, which has led to questions as to 
      its' potential application, especially in relation to its effect on opioid use. 
      OBJECTIVES: This study investigates a proposed clinical context in offering medical 
      cannabis as a treatment for chronic pain for those already using chronic opioid 
      therapy. It then details patients' daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) usage. 
      STUDY DESIGN: This single-center prospective study follows a group of patients 
      trialing medical cannabis treatment for chronic pain that is already using COT in 
      order to determine individual efficacy. Continued medical cannabis treatment was a 
      decision made by the patient, after trialing medical cannabis, to either continue 
      medical cannabis along with COT at a reduced daily MME, or to revert back to their 
      previous COT regimen. SETTING: This study was performed at the Allegheny Health 
      Network Institute for Pain Medicine in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The state of 
      Pennsylvania legalized medical cannabis in April of 2016, and it became available to 
      patients in February of 2018 through medical dispensaries. METHODS: One hundred and 
      fifteen patients met the inclusion criteria, with the majority of those excluded due 
      to not being treated with COT. Of the 115 who chose to undergo a medical cannabis 
      trial in addition to their COT, 75 chose to remain certified for medical cannabis as 
      they had significant pain relief and subsequently weaned down on opioids. 
      Additionally, of the 115 choosing to undergo a medical cannabis trial, 30 chose to 
      be decertified due to ineffectiveness or side effects, and those were placed back on 
      their COT regimen. The other 10 were not included for other denoted reasons. 
      Compliance was monitored through urine drug screens (UDS). RESULTS: There was a 
      67.1% average decrease in daily MME/patient from 49.9 to 16.4 MME at the first 
      follow-up. There was a 73.3% decrease in MME at second follow-up from 49.9 to 13.3 
      MME with an ANOVA analysis denoting a significant difference of P < 0.0001. 
      LIMITATIONS: The period of follow-up presented at this point includes their first 6 
      months of treatment with medical cannabis and COT concomitantly. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Presenting medical cannabis to chronic pain patients on COT should be done in the 
      context of a patient choice between medical cannabis WITH decrement of COT or 
      continued current dose of COT in order to maximize effectiveness in opioid reduction 
      as well as to limit polypharmacy concerns regarding medical cannabis. Allowing for a 
      temporary short-term period where patients may trial medical cannabis, while 
      concomitantly gradually weaning their COT, is also essential in determining medical 
      cannabis' individual effectiveness for that patient's specific type of chronic pain, 
      which should serve to maximize long-term opioid reduction results and hence decrease 
      opioid-related overdose deaths.

TI  - Cannabinoid-related agents in the treatment of anxiety disorders: current knowledge 
      and future perspectives.
PG  - 25-40
AB  - Rich evidence has shown that cannabis products exert a broad gamut of effects on 
      emotional regulation. The main psychoactive ingredient of hemp, 
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and its synthetic cannabinoid analogs have been 
      reported to either attenuate or exacerbate anxiety and fear-related behaviors in 
      humans and experimental animals. The heterogeneity of cannabis-induced psychological 
      outcomes reflects a complex network of molecular interactions between the key 
      neurobiological substrates of anxiety and fear and the endogenous cannabinoid 
      system, mainly consisting of the arachidonic acid derivatives anandamide and 
      2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and two receptors, respectively termed CB1 and CB2. 
      The high degree of interindividual variability in the responses to cannabis is 
      contributed by a wide spectrum of factors, including genetic and environmental 
      determinants, as well as differences in the relative concentrations of THC and other 
      alkaloids (such as cannabidiol) within the plant itself. The present article reviews 
      the currently available knowledge on the herbal, synthetic and endogenous 
      cannabinoids with respect to the modulation of anxiety responses, and highlights the 
      challenges that should be overcome to harness the therapeutic potential of some of 
      these compounds, all the while limiting the side effects associated with cannabis 
      consumption. In addition the article presents some promising patents on 
      cannabinoid-related agents.

AB  - Despite recent advances in behavioral interventions for cannabis use disorders, 
      effect sizes remain modest, and few individuals achieve long-term abstinence. One 
      strategy to enhance outcomes is the addition of pharmacotherapy to complement 
      behavioral treatment, but to date no efficacious medications targeting cannabis use 
      disorders in adults through large, randomized controlled trials have been 
      identified. The National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (NIDA CTN) 
      is currently conducting a study to test the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 
      versus placebo (PBO), added to contingency management, for cannabis cessation in 
      adults (ages 18-50). This study was designed to replicate positive findings from a 
      study in cannabis-dependent adolescents that found greater odds of abstinence with 
      NAC compared to PBO. This paper describes the design and implementation of an 
      ongoing 12-week, intent-to-treat, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 
      with one follow-up visit four weeks post-treatment. Approximately 300 
      treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent adults will be randomized to NAC or PBO across 
      six study sites in the United States. The primary objective of this 12-week study is 
      to evaluate the efficacy of twice-daily orally-administered NAC (1200 mg) versus 
      matched PBO, added to contingency management, on cannabis abstinence. NAC is among 
      the first medications to demonstrate increased odds of abstinence in a randomized 
      controlled study among cannabis users in any age group. The current study will 
      assess the cannabis cessation efficacy of NAC combined with a behavioral 
      intervention in adults, providing a novel and timely contribution to the evidence 
      base for the treatment of cannabis use disorders.

AB  - Many studies have reported that heavy substance use is associated with impaired 
      response inhibition. Studies typically focused on associations with a single 
      substance, while polysubstance use is common. Further, most studies compared heavy 
      users with light/non-users, though substance use occurs along a continuum. The 
      current mega-analysis accounted for these issues by aggregating individual data from 
      43 studies (3610 adult participants) that used the Go/No-Go (GNG) or Stop-signal 
      task (SST) to assess inhibition among mostly "recreational" substance users (i.e., 
      the rate of substance use disorders was low). Main and interaction effects of 
      substance use, demographics, and task-characteristics were entered in a linear mixed 
      model. Contrary to many studies and reviews in the field, we found that only 
      lifetime cannabis use was associated with impaired response inhibition in the SST. 
      An interaction effect was also observed: the relationship between tobacco use and 
      response inhibition (in the SST) differed between cannabis users and non-users, with 
      a negative association between tobacco use and inhibition in the cannabis non-users. 
      In addition, participants' age, education level, and some task characteristics 
      influenced inhibition outcomes. Overall, we found limited support for impaired 
      inhibition among substance users when controlling for demographics and 
      task-characteristics.

TI  - Extractions of Medical Cannabis Cultivars and the Role of Decarboxylation in Optimal 
      Receptor Responses.
PG  - 183-194
LID - 10.1089/can.2018.0067 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Phytocannabinoids, characteristic compounds produced by medical 
      cannabis, interact with cannabinoid (CB) receptors (CB1 and CB2) as well as other 
      receptor systems to exhibit their corresponding pharmacological effects. In their 
      natural form, CBs such as Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid and cannabidiolic acid 
      are inactive at these receptors, while their decarboxylated forms 
      (Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, respectively) are potent ligands at CB 
      receptors. Thus, extraction and processing of medical cannabis for active 
      constituents are important. Purpose and Methods: Patients consuming medical cannabis 
      often have limited alternative treatment options and in recent years, medical 
      cannabis extracts have been popular as a substitute for dried cannabis plants, 
      despite limited studies on these derivatives. We investigated three disparate 
      cannabis cultivars and compared four chemical extraction methods head to head, viz. 
      Soxhlet, ultrasound-assisted supercritical fluid, and microwave-assisted 
      extractions, for their efficiency. We further characterized the chemical 
      compositions of these extracts. Results: Microwave extraction consistently produced 
      completely decarboxylated phytocannabinoid extracts. Factors such as temperature and 
      exposure time play important roles in the decarboxylation of phytocannabinoids, 
      thereby generating pharmacologically active CBs, and these conditions may differ for 
      each cannabis cultivar. Conclusion: Chemical consistency and potency due to active 
      compounds are in turn important in producing consistent and reliable medical 
      cannabis extracts and their derivatives. These processes must be subject to higher 
      levels of scientific rigor as the patient population around the world are seeking 
      the help of such extracts for various clinical conditions, and as medical cannabis 
      industry is receiving acceptance in various countries.

TI  - Adverse Effects of Cannabis on Adolescent Brain Development: A Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 1922-1930
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhw015 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis is widely perceived as a safe recreational drug and its use is increasing 
      in youth. It is important to understand the implications of cannabis use during 
      childhood and adolescence on brain development. This is the first longitudinal study 
      that compared resting functional connectivity of frontally mediated networks between 
      43 healthy controls (HCs; 20 females; age M = 16.5 ± 2.7) and 22 treatment-seeking 
      adolescents with cannabis use disorder (CUD; 8 females; age M = 17.6 ± 2.4). 
      Increases in resting functional connectivity between caudal anterior cingulate 
      cortex (ACC) and superior frontal gyrus across time were found in HC, but not in 
      CUD. CUD showed a decrease in functional connectivity between caudal ACC and 
      dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortices across time. Lower functional connectivity 
      between caudal ACC cortex and orbitofrontal cortex at baseline predicted higher 
      amounts of cannabis use during the following 18 months. Finally, high amounts of 
      cannabis use during the 18-month interval predicted lower intelligence quotient and 
      slower cognitive function measured at follow-up. These data provide compelling 
      longitudinal evidence suggesting that repeated exposure to cannabis during 
      adolescence may have detrimental effects on brain resting functional connectivity, 
      intelligence, and cognitive function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk-based decision making is altered in people with schizophrenia and 
      in people with cannabis use compared to healthy controls; the pattern of 
      risk-assessment in people with co-occurring schizophrenia and cannabis dependence is 
      poorly understood. This study examined measures of risk-taking and decision-making 
      in people with and without schizophrenia and/or cannabis dependence. METHODS: 
      Participants with schizophrenia (n=24), cannabis dependence (n=23), schizophrenia 
      and co-occurring cannabis dependence (n=18), and healthy controls (n=24) were 
      recruited from the community via advertisements and completed a one-visit battery of 
      symptom, risk-based decision making, gambling behavior, cognitive, and addiction 
      assessments. This report presents self-assessments of self-mastery, optimism, 
      impulsivity, and sensation seeking and a behavioral assessment of risk (Balloon 
      Analog Risk Task [BART]). RESULTS: On self-report measures, participants with 
      schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis dependence were intermediate between those 
      with only cannabis dependence or only schizophrenia on ratings of self-mastery, 
      sensation-seeking, and impulsivity. There were no group differences on ratings of 
      optimism. Their behavior on the BART was most similar to participants with only 
      cannabis dependence or healthy controls, rather than to participants with only 
      schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: People with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis 
      dependence may represent a unique group in terms of risk-perception and risk-taking. 
      This has implications for interventions designed to influence health behaviors such 
      as motivational interviewing.

TI  - Daily use of high-potency cannabis is associated with more positive symptoms in 
      first-episode psychosis patients: the EU-GEI case-control study.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1017/S0033291720000082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daily use of high-potency cannabis has been reported to carry a high 
      risk for developing a psychotic disorder. However, the evidence is mixed on whether 
      any pattern of cannabis use is associated with a particular symptomatology in 
      first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. METHOD: We analysed data from 901 FEP 
      patients and 1235 controls recruited across six countries, as part of the European 
      Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions 
      (EU-GEI) study. We used item response modelling to estimate two bifactor models, 
      which included general and specific dimensions of psychotic symptoms in patients and 
      psychotic experiences in controls. The associations between these dimensions and 
      cannabis use were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models analyses. RESULTS: In 
      patients, there was a linear relationship between the positive symptom dimension and 
      the extent of lifetime exposure to cannabis, with daily users of high-potency 
      cannabis having the highest score (B = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.56). Moreover, negative 
      symptoms were more common among patients who never used cannabis compared with those 
      with any pattern of use (B = -0.22; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.07). In controls, psychotic 
      experiences were associated with current use of cannabis but not with the extent of 
      lifetime use. Neither patients nor controls presented differences in depressive 
      dimension related to cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first 
      large-scale evidence that FEP patients with a history of daily use of high-potency 
      cannabis present with more positive and less negative symptoms, compared with those 
      who never used cannabis or used low-potency types.

AB  - Cannabis and alcohol are believed to have widespread effects on the brain. Although 
      adolescents are at increased risk for substance use, the adolescent brain may also 
      be particularly vulnerable to the effects of drug exposure due to its rapid 
      maturation. Here, we examined the association between cannabis and alcohol use 
      duration and resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of male 
      juvenile delinquents. The present sample was drawn from the Southwest Advanced 
      Neuroimaging Cohort, Youth sample, and from a youth detention facility in Wisconsin. 
      All participants were scanned at the maximum-security facilities using The Mind 
      Research Network's 1.5T Avanto SQ Mobile MRI scanner. Information on cannabis and 
      alcohol regular use duration was collected using self-report. Resting-state networks 
      were computed using group independent component analysis in 201 participants. 
      Associations with cannabis and alcohol use were assessed using Mancova analyses 
      controlling for age, IQ, smoking and psychopathy scores in the complete case sample 
      of 180 male juvenile delinquents. No associations between alcohol or cannabis use 
      and network spatial maps were found. Longer cannabis use was associated with 
      decreased low frequency power of the default mode network, the executive control 
      networks (ECNs), and several sensory networks, and with decreased functional network 
      connectivity. Duration of alcohol use was associated with decreased low frequency 
      power of the right frontoparietal network, salience network, dorsal attention 
      network, and several sensory networks. Our findings suggest that adolescent cannabis 
      and alcohol use are associated with widespread differences in resting-state time 
      course power spectra, which may persist even after abstinence.

TI  - The association between regular cannabis use, with and without tobacco co-use, and 
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes: cannabis may have a greater impact in non-tobacco 
      smokers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the potential impact of cannabis use on cardiovascular 
      health is increasingly important as cannabis use rises in the U.S. Objectives: This 
      study evaluated the associations between regular cannabis use, with and without 
      tobacco co-use, and cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: Analysis of a limited dataset 
      obtained through IBM Watson Health Explorys, a platform integrating electronic 
      health record data. Matched controls using Mahalanobis distance within propensity 
      score calipers were defined for: 1) cannabis-using patients (n = 8,944; 43% female); 
      and subgroups of cannabis-using patients: 2) with an encounter diagnosis for tobacco 
      use disorder (TUD; n = 4,682); and 3) without a TUD diagnosis (non-TUD; n = 4,262). 
      Patients had ≥1 blood pressure measurement and blood chemistry lab result in the 
      MetroHealth System (Cleveland, Ohio). Cannabis-using patients had an encounter 
      diagnosis of cannabis abuse/dependence and/or ≥2 cannabis-positive urine drug 
      screens. Control patients, with no cannabis-use-documentation, were matched to the 
      cannabis-using patients on demographics, residential zip code median income, body 
      mass index, and, for the total sample, TUD-status. Outcomes were encounter diagnosis 
      (yes/no) of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), heart arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: TUD-patients had 
      the greatest prevalence of cardiovascular disease, regardless of cannabis-use 
      indication. In the total sample and non-TUD subgroup, regular cannabis use was 
      significantly associated with greater risk for CVA, arrhythmia, SAH, and mortality. 
      In the TUD subgroup, regular cannabis use was significantly associated with greater 
      risk for arrhythmia and SAH. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use is associated with 
      significantly greater risk of adverse cardiovascular diagnoses and overall death, 
      particularly in non-tobacco users.

TI  - Associations of cannabis use disorder with cognition, brain structure, and brain 
      function in African Americans.

AB  - Although previous studies have highlighted associations of cannabis use with 
      cognition and brain morphometry, critical questions remain with regard to the 
      association between cannabis use and brain structural and functional connectivity. 
      In a cross-sectional community sample of 205 African Americans (age 18-70) we tested 
      for associations of cannabis use disorder (CUD, n = 57) with multi-domain cognitive 
      measures and structural, diffusion, and resting state brain-imaging phenotypes. Post 
      hoc model evidence was computed with Bayes factors (BF) and posterior probabilities 
      of association (PPA) to account for multiple testing. General cognitive functioning, 
      verbal intelligence, verbal memory, working memory, and motor speed were lower in 
      the CUD group compared with non-users (p < .011; 1.9 < BF < 3,217). CUD was 
      associated with altered functional connectivity in a network comprising the 
      motor-hand region in the superior parietal gyri and the anterior insula (p < .04). 
      These differences were not explained by alcohol, other drug use, or education. No 
      associations with CUD were observed in cortical thickness, cortical surface area, 
      subcortical or cerebellar volumes (0.12 < BF < 1.5), or graph-theoretical metrics of 
      resting state connectivity (PPA < 0.01). In a large sample collected irrespective of 
      cannabis used to minimize recruitment bias, we confirm the literature on poorer 
      cognitive functioning in CUD, and an absence of volumetric brain differences between 
      CUD and non-CUD. We did not find evidence for or against a disruption of structural 
      connectivity, whereas we did find localized resting state functional dysconnectivity 
      in CUD. There was sufficient proof, however, that organization of functional 
      connectivity as determined via graph metrics does not differ between CUD and 
      non-user group.

TI  - Identification of fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins in textile hemp (Cannabis 
      sativa L.): in silico analyses and gene expression patterns in different tissues.
PG  - 741
LID - 10.1186/s12864-017-3970-5 [doi]
LID - 741
AB  - BACKGROUND: The fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs) belong to the 
      arabinogalactan protein (AGP) superfamily and are known to play different 
      physiological roles in plants. This class of proteins was shown to participate in 
      plant growth, development, defense against abiotic stresses and, notably, cell wall 
      biosynthesis. Although some studies are available on the characterization of FLA 
      genes from different species, both woody and herbaceous, no detailed information is 
      available on the FLA family of textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), an economically 
      important fibre crop. RESULTS: By searching the Cannabis genome and EST databases, 
      23 CsaFLAs have been here identified which are divided into four phylogenetic 
      groups. A real-time qPCR analysis performed on stem tissues (isolated bast fibres 
      and shivs sampled at three heights), hypocotyls (6-9-12-15-17-20 days-old), whole 
      seedlings, roots, leaves and female/male flowers of the monoecious fibre variety 
      Santhica 27, indicates that the identified FLA genes are differentially expressed. 
      Interestingly, some hemp FLAs are expressed during early phases of fibre growth 
      (elongation), while others are more expressed in the middle and base of the stem and 
      thus potentially involved in secondary cell wall formation (fibre thickening). The 
      bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions shows that the FLAs upregulated in 
      the younger regions of the stem share a conserved motif related to flowering control 
      and regulation of photoperiod perception. The promoters of the FLA genes expressed 
      at higher levels in the older stem regions, instead, share a motif putatively 
      recognized by MYB3, a transcriptional repressor belonging to the MYB family subgroup 
      S4. CONCLUSIONS: These results point to the existence of a transcriptional network 
      fine-tuning the expression of FLA genes in the older and younger regions of the 
      stem, as well as in the bast fibres/shivs of textile hemp. In summary, our study 
      paves the way for future analyses on the biological functions of FLAs in an 
      industrially relevant fibre crop.

AB  - Background: Homeless youth in the United States have high rates of substance use. 
      Existing research has identified social network composition and street-associated 
      stressors as contributing factors. Incarceration is a highly prevalent stressor for 
      homeless youth. Its effect on youth's social network composition and substance use, 
      however, has been neglected. Aims: This study investigated the direct and indirect 
      associations between incarceration history and substance use (through social 
      networks) among homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Methods: A sample of 1047 
      homeless youths were recruited between 2011 and 2013. Computerized 
      self-administrated surveys and social network interviews were conducted to collect 
      youth's sociodemographic characteristics, incarceration history, social network 
      composition, and substance use. Bootstrapping was used to identify the direct and 
      indirect associations between youth's incarceration history and substance use. 
      Results: Incarceration history was positively associated with youth's cannabis, 
      methamphetamine, and injection drug use. The percentage of cannabis-using peers 
      partially mediated the associations between incarceration history and youth's 
      cannabis, cocaine, and heroin use. The percentage of methamphetamine-using peers 
      partially mediated the associations between incarceration history and youth's 
      methamphetamine, cocaine, and injection drug use. The percentage of heroin-using 
      peers partially mediated the association between incarceration history and youth's 
      heroin use. Moreover, the percentage of peers who inject drugs partially mediated 
      the associations between incarceration history and youth's methamphetamine, heroin, 
      and injection drug use. Discussion: Incarceration history should be taken to a more 
      central place in future research and practice with homeless youth in the United 
      States.

TI  - Microbiome of Field Grown Hemp Reveals Potential Microbial Interactions With Root 
      and Rhizosphere Soil.

AB  - Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a crop bred and grown for the production of fiber, 
      grain, and floral extracts that contribute to health and wellness. Hemp plants 
      interact with a myriad of microbiota inhabiting the phyllosphere, endosphere, 
      rhizoplane, and rhizosphere. These microbes offer many ecological services, 
      particularly those of below ground biotopes which are involved in nutrient cycling, 
      uptake, and alleviating biotic and abiotic stress. The microbiota communities of the 
      hemp rhizosphere in the field are not well documented. To discover core microbiota 
      associated with field grown hemp, we cultivated single C. sativa cultivar, "TJ's 
      CBD," in six different fields in New York and sampled hemp roots and their 
      rhizospheric soil. We used Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing targeting 16S 
      ribosomal DNA of bacteria and ITS of fungi to study microbial community structure of 
      hemp roots and rhizospheres. We found that Planctobacteria and Ascomycota dominated 
      the taxonomic composition of hemp associated microbial community. We identified 
      potential core microbiota in each community (bacteria: eight bacterial amplicon 
      sequence variant - ASV, identified as Gimesia maris, Pirellula sp. Lacipirellula 
      limnantheis, Gemmata sp. and unclassified Planctobacteria; fungi: three ASVs 
      identified as Fusarium oxysporum, Gibellulopsis piscis, and Mortierella 
      minutissima). We found 14 ASVs as hub taxa [eight bacterial ASVs (BASV) in the root, 
      and four bacterial and two fungal ASVs in the rhizosphere soil], and 10 BASV 
      connected the root and rhizosphere soil microbiota to form an extended microbial 
      communication in hemp. The only hub taxa detected in both the root and rhizosphere 
      soil microbiota was ASV37 (Caulifigura coniformis), a bacterial taxon. The core 
      microbiota and Network hub taxa can be studied further for biocontrol activities and 
      functional investigations in the formulation of hemp bioinoculants. This study 
      documented the microbial diversity and community structure of hemp grown in six 
      fields, which could contribute toward the development of bioinoculants for hemp that 
      could be used in organic farming.

TI  - Quantifying cannabis problems among college students from English and Spanish 
      speaking countries: Cross-cultural validation of the Cannabis Use Disorders 
      Identification Test-Revised (CUDIT-R).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test - Revised (CUDIT-R) is a 
      broadly employed measure of cannabis-related problems. However, minimal research has 
      tested the measurement invariance of the CUDIT-R among youths from different 
      countries, hindering cross-national comparisons. Thus, the present study aimed to 
      test the measurement invariance of the CUDIT-R between seven countries and gender 
      groups, and provide different sources of reliability and validity evidence of the 
      scale. METHODS: A sample of 4,712 college student lifetime cannabis users (mean 
      age = 20.57, SD = 3.97; 70.4% females) from seven countries completed the CUDIT-R. 
      Last 30-day cannabis users (n = 2402; mean age = 20.09, SD = 3.18; 67.7% females) 
      additionally completed another measure of cannabis-related problems, and measures of 
      cannabis frequency, quantity and motives. RESULTS: Multigroup analysis showed 
      configural (equal number of factors and pattern of factor-indicator relationships), 
      metric (equal factor loadings) and scalar (equal thresholds) invariance of the 
      CUDIT-R across five countries and across gender in the sample of lifetime cannabis 
      users. Cronbach's alphas and ordinal omegas ranked from .72 and .85. Large 
      correlations were found between the CUDIT-R and another cannabis-related problem 
      scale. Small to large associations were found between the CUDIT-R and other 
      criterion variables (frequency and quantity of consumption and cannabis-related 
      motives) providing convergent and discriminant validity evidence. Only a few 
      differences in the magnitude of the correlations across countries were found. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the CUDIT-R is a suitable measure to assess 
      cannabis-related problems among college student from the U.S., Canada, South Africa, 
      Spain, and Argentina and across gender groups.

AB  - Public opinion surrounding the recreational use and therapeutic potential of 
      cannabis is shifting. This review describes new work examining the behavioural and 
      neural effects of cannabis and the endocannabinoid system, highlighting key regions 
      within corticolimbic brain circuits. First, we consider the role of human genetic 
      factors and cannabis strain chemotypic differences in contributing to 
      interindividual variation in the response to cannabinoids, such as THC, and review 
      studies demonstrating that THC-induced impairments in decision-making processes are 
      mediated by actions at prefrontal CB(1) receptors. We further describe evidence that 
      signalling through prefrontal or ventral hippocampal CB(1) receptors modulates 
      mesolimbic dopamine activity, aberrations of which may contribute to emotional 
      processing deficits in schizophrenia. Lastly, we review studies suggesting that 
      endocannabinoid tone in the amygdala is a critical regulator of anxiety, and report 
      new data showing that FAAH activity is integral to this response. Together, these 
      findings underscore the importance of cannabinoid signalling in the regulation of 
      cognitive and affective behaviours, and encourage further research given their 
      social, political, and therapeutic implications.

AB  - In spite of suppressive antiretroviral therapies (ART), Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
      (HIV)-infected subjects still experience the consequences of viral persistence and 
      chronic inflammation. In the brain, where most HIV-1 targets are of innate immune 
      origin, neurological and cognitive impairments are detectable and enhanced by highly 
      prevalent substance use disorders. Cannabis is one of the most prevalent substances 
      among HIV+ ​subjects, compared to non-infected populations, either prescribed for 
      improving various symptoms or used recreationally, as well as a component of 
      polysubstance use. The mechanisms by which addictive substances and HIV interact are 
      multifactorial and poorly understood. Importantly, the HIV brain target cells, 
      macrophages and microglia, express receptors to neurotransmitters elevated by such 
      drugs, and express receptors to cannabinoids, particularly CB2R. We have tested a 
      panel of 784 transcripts associated with neurological disorders, digitally 
      multiplexed and detectable in peripheral blood cells from a small cohort (n ​= ​102) 
      of HIV-positive (HIV+) and HIV-negative (HIV-) specimens, stratified based on 
      criteria of lifetime (LT) dependence of cannabis (CAN+) or not (CAN-). Demographic 
      homogeneity and low incidence of co-morbidities helped increase power and allowed 
      the identification of key differences consistent with HIV infection, cannabis 
      exposure, or their interactions. A small percentage of these subjects used cannabis 
      as well as other drugs. The data was analyzed using robust systems and visualization 
      strategies to detect orchestrated patterns in gene networks connected based on 
      molecular interfaces with higher power than in single genes. We found that the 
      effects of cannabis differed drastically between HIV- and HIV+ ​groups, particularly 
      in gene networks playing a role in inflammation, neurodegeneration, apoptosis and 
      leukocyte adhesion and transmigration. At the level of individual genes, we 
      identified detrimental effects that were associated with polysubstance use as a 
      covariate, particularly methamphetamine. Transcription factor usage predictions 
      suggest that the effects of cannabis are associated with transcriptional 
      co-regulation at the gene promoters by multiple factors that vary by context. 
      Overall, we have found that the effects of cannabis may be context-dependent, with 
      potential benefits in the context of HIV reflected by improvements in cognition, but 
      in the absence of the polysubstance use component.

TI  - Concomitant Cannabis Misuse and Associations with Depression, Pain and Substance 
      Misuse among Patients Prescribed Opioids.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy9030134 [doi]
LID - 134
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is common among individuals with pain who are prescribed 
      opioids, occurring in approximately 10% of this population. This study aims to 
      explore the relationship between non-medical cannabis use and other health risks 
      among individuals filling opioids at community pharmacies. METHODS: This study was 
      an exploratory secondary data analysis of a National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical 
      Trials Network (CTN)-sponsored study, Validation of a Community Pharmacy-Based 
      Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Risk Screening, examining the relationship 
      between risky cannabis use and depressive symptoms, pain, overdose, and other 
      substance misuse among individuals filling opioid prescriptions in community 
      pharmacies (N = 1440). RESULTS: Participants reporting moderate- to high-risk 
      compared to low-risk cannabis use were more likely to report depressive symptoms 
      (adjusted OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.11-2.56), history of overdose (adjusted OR = 2.15, 
      95% CI = 1.34-3.44), and moderate- to high-risk use of alcohol (adjusted OR = 2.10, 
      95% CI = 1.28-3.45), opioids (adjusted OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.67-3.76), sedatives 
      (adjusted OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.72-3.86), stimulants (adjusted OR = 4.79, 95% CI = 
      2.83-8.01), and tobacco (adjusted OR = 3.60, 95% CI = 2.47-5.24). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Community pharmacies may be valuable sites for identifying, studying, and 
      intervening with substance use problems.

LID - e000638
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is known to be associated with neuropsychiatric problems, but 
      less is known about complications affecting other specified body systems. We report 
      and analyze 35 recent remarkable cardiovascular complications following cannabis 
      use. METHODS AND RESULTS: In France, serious cases of abuse and dependence in 
      response to the use of psychoactive substances must be reported to the national 
      system of the French Addictovigilance Network. We identified all spontaneous reports 
      of cardiovascular complications related to cannabis use collected by the French 
      Addictovigilance Network from 2006 to 2010. We described the clinical 
      characteristics of these cases and their evolution: 1.8% of all cannabis-related 
      reports (35/1979) were cardiovascular complications, with patients being mostly men 
      (85.7%) and of an average age of 34.3 years. There were 22 cardiac complications (20 
      acute coronary syndromes), 10 peripheral complications (lower limb or juvenile 
      arteriopathies and Buerger-like diseases), and 3 cerebral complications (acute 
      cerebral angiopathy, transient cortical blindness, and spasm of cerebral artery). In 
      9 cases, the event led to patient death. CONCLUSIONS: Increased reporting of 
      cardiovascular complications related to cannabis and their extreme seriousness (with 
      a death rate of 25.6%) indicate cannabis as a possible risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease in young adults, in line with previous findings. Given that 
      cannabis is perceived to be harmless by the general public and that legalization of 
      its use is debated, data concerning its danger must be widely disseminated. 
      Practitioners should be aware that cannabis may be a potential triggering factor for 
      cardiovascular complications in young people.

TI  - "If I knew I could get that every hour instead of alcohol, I would take the 
      cannabis": need and feasibility of cannabis substitution implementation in Canadian 
      managed alcohol programs.
PG  - 65

AB  - BACKGROUND: While there is robust evidence for strategies to reduce harms of illicit 
      drug use, less attention has been paid to alcohol harm reduction for people 
      experiencing severe alcohol use disorder (AUD), homelessness, and street-based 
      illicit drinking. Managed Alcohol Programs (MAPs) provide safer and regulated 
      sources of alcohol and other supports within a harm reduction framework. To reduce 
      the impacts of heavy long-term alcohol use among MAP participants, cannabis 
      substitution has been identified as a potential therapeutic tool. METHODS: To 
      determine the feasibility of cannabis substitution, we conducted a 
      pre-implementation mixed-methods study utilizing structured surveys and open-ended 
      interviews. Data were collected from MAP organizational leaders (n = 7), program 
      participants (n = 19), staff and managers (n = 17) across 6 MAPs in Canada. We used 
      the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform and organize 
      our analysis. RESULTS: Five themes describing feasibility of CSP implementation in 
      MAPs were identified. The first theme describes the characteristics of potential CSP 
      participants. Among MAP participants, 63% (n = 12) were already substituting 
      cannabis for alcohol, most often on a weekly basis (n = 8, 42.1%), for alcohol 
      cravings (n = 15, 78.9%,) and withdrawal (n = 10, 52.6%). Most MAP participants 
      expressed willingness to participate in a CSP (n = 16, 84.2%). The second theme 
      describes the characteristics of a feasible and preferred CSP model according to 
      participants and staff. Participants preferred staff administration of dry, smoked 
      cannabis, followed by edibles and capsules with replacement of some doses of alcohol 
      through a partial substitution model. Themes three and four highlight organizational 
      and contextual factors related to feasibility of implementing CSPs. MAP participants 
      requested peer, social, and counselling supports. Staff requested education 
      resources and enhanced clinical staffing. Critically, program staff and leaders 
      identified that sustainable funding and inexpensive, legal, and reliable sourcing of 
      cannabis are needed to support CSP implementation. CONCLUSION: Cannabis substitution 
      was considered feasible by all three groups and in some MAPs residents are already 
      using cannabis. Partial substitution of cannabis for doses of alcohol was preferred. 
      All three groups identified a need for additional supports for implementation 
      including peer support, staff education, and counselling. Sourcing and funding 
      cannabis were identified as primary challenges to successful CSP implementation in 
      MAPs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread commercialization of cannabis has led to the introduction of 
      brand names based on users' subjective experience of psychological effects and 
      flavors, but this process has occurred in the absence of agreed standards. The 
      objective of this work was to leverage information extracted from large databases to 
      evaluate the consistency and validity of these subjective reports, and to determine 
      their correlation with the reported cultivars and with estimates of their chemical 
      composition (delta-9-THC, CBD, terpenes). METHODS: We analyzed a large publicly 
      available dataset extracted from Leafly.com where users freely reported their 
      experiences with cannabis cultivars, including different subjective effects and 
      flavour associations. This analysis was complemented with information on the 
      chemical composition of a subset of the cultivars extracted from Psilabs.org . The 
      structure of this dataset was investigated using network analysis applied to the 
      pairwise similarities between reported subjective effects and/or chemical 
      compositions. Random forest classifiers were used to evaluate whether reports of 
      flavours and subjective effects could identify the labelled species cultivar. We 
      applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to free narratives written by the 
      users to validate the subjective effect and flavour tags. Finally, we explored the 
      relationship between terpenoid content, cannabinoid composition and subjective 
      reports in a subset of the cultivars. RESULTS: Machine learning classifiers 
      distinguished between species tags given by "Cannabis sativa" and "Cannabis indica" 
      based on the reported flavours: <AUC> = 0.828 ± 0.002 (p < 0.001); and effects: 
      <AUC> = 0.9965 ± 0.0002 (p < 0.001). A significant relationship between terpene and 
      cannabinoid content was suggested by positive correlations between subjective effect 
      and flavour tags (p < 0.05, False-Discovery-rate (FDR)-corrected); these 
      correlations clustered the reported effects into three groups that represented 
      unpleasant, stimulant and soothing effects. The use of predefined tags was validated 
      by applying latent semantic analysis tools to unstructured written reviews, also 
      providing breed-specific topics consistent with their purported subjective effects. 
      Terpene profiles matched the perceptual characterizations made by the users, 
      particularly for the terpene-flavours graph (Q = 0.324). CONCLUSIONS: Our work 
      represents the first data-driven synthesis of self-reported and chemical information 
      in a large number of cannabis cultivars. Since terpene content is robustly inherited 
      and less influenced by environmental factors, flavour perception could represent a 
      reliable marker to indirectly characterize the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Our 
      novel methodology helps meet demands for reliable cultivar characterization in the 
      context of an ever-growing market for medicinal and recreational cannabis.

TI  - Identifying HIV care enrollees at-risk for cannabis use disorder.
PG  - 846-850

AB  - Increased scientific attention given to cannabis in the United States has particular 
      relevance for its domestic HIV care population, given that evidence exists for both 
      cannabis as a therapeutic agent and cannabis use disorder (CUD) as a barrier to 
      antiretroviral medication adherence. It is critical to identify relative risk for 
      CUD among demographic subgroups of HIV patients, as this will inform detection and 
      intervention efforts. A Center For AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical 
      Systems cohort (N = 10,652) of HIV-positive adults linked to care at seven United 
      State sites was examined for this purpose. Based on a patient-report instrument with 
      validated diagnostic threshold for CUD, the prevalence of recent cannabis use and 
      corresponding conditional probabilities for CUD were calculated for the aggregate 
      sample and demographic subgroups. Generalized estimating equations then tested 
      models directly examining patient demographic indices as predictors of CUD, while 
      controlling for history and geography. Conditional probability of CUD among 
      cannabis-using patients was 49%, with the highest conditional probabilities among 
      demographic subgroups of young adults and those with non-specified sexual 
      orientation (67-69%) and the lowest conditional probability among females and those 
      50+ years of age (42% apiece). Similarly, youthful age and male gender emerged as 
      robust multivariate model predictors of CUD. In the context of increasingly lenient 
      policies for use of cannabis as a therapeutic agent for chronic conditions like 
      HIV/AIDS, current study findings offer needed direction in terms of specifying 
      targeted patient groups in HIV care on whom resources for enhanced surveillance and 
      intervention efforts will be most impactful.

TI  - Vaping-Related Mobile Apps Available in the Google Play Store After the Apple Ban: 
      Content Review.
PG  - e20009
LID - 10.2196/20009 [doi]
LID - e20009
AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to health concerns about vaping devices (eg, youth nicotine 
      use, lung injury), Apple removed 181 previously approved vaping-related apps from 
      the App Store in November 2019. This policy change may lessen youth exposure to 
      content that glamorizes vaping; however, it may also block important sources of 
      information and vaping device control for adults seeking to use vaping devices 
      safely. OBJECTIVE: Understanding the types of nicotine and cannabis vaping-related 
      apps still available in the competing Google Play Store can shed light on how 
      digital apps may reflect information available to consumers. METHODS: In December 
      2019, we searched the Google Play Store for vaping-related apps using the keywords 
      "vape" and "vaping" and reviewed the first 100 apps presented in the results. We 
      reviewed app titles, descriptions, screenshots, and metadata to categorize the 
      intended substance (nicotine or cannabis/tetrahydrocannabinol) and the app's 
      purpose. The most installed apps in each purpose category were downloaded and 
      evaluated for quality and usability with the Mobile App Rating Scale. RESULTS: Of 
      the first 100 apps, 79 were related to vaping. Of these 79 apps, 43 (54%) were 
      specific to nicotine, 3 (4%) were specific to cannabis, 1 (1%) was intended for 
      either, and for the remaining 31 (39%), the intended substance was unclear. The most 
      common purposes of the apps were making do-it-yourself e-liquids (28/79, 35%) or 
      coils (25/79, 32%), games/entertainment (19/79, 24%), social networking (16/79, 
      20%), and shopping for vaping products (15/79, 19%). Of the 79 apps, at least 4 apps 
      (5%) paired with vaping devices to control temperature or dose settings, 8 apps 
      (10%) claimed to help people quit smoking using vaping, and 2 apps (3%) had the goal 
      of helping people quit vaping. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of vaping-related apps in 
      the Google Play Store had features either to help users continue vaping, such as 
      information for modifying devices, or to maintain interest in vaping. Few apps were 
      for controlling device settings or assisting with quitting smoking or vaping. 
      Assuming that these Google Play Store apps were similar in content to the Apple App 
      Store apps that were removed, it appears that Apple's ban would have a minimal 
      effect on people who vape with the intention of quitting smoking or who are seeking 
      information about safer vaping via mobile apps.

TI  - Four Mechanistic Models of Peer Influence on Adolescent Cannabis Use.
PG  - 90-99
LID - 10.1007/s40429-017-0144-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Most adolescents begin exploring cannabis in peer contexts, but 
      the neural mechanisms that underlie peer influence on adolescent cannabis use are 
      still unknown. This theoretical overview elucidates the intersecting roles of neural 
      function and peer factors in cannabis use in adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: Novel 
      paradigms using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in adolescents have 
      identified distinct neural mechanisms of risk decision-making and incentive 
      processing in peer contexts, centered on reward-motivation and affect regulatory 
      neural networks; these findings inform a theoretical model of peer-driven cannabis 
      use decisions in adolescents. SUMMARY: We propose four "mechanistic profiles" of 
      social facilitation of cannabis use in adolescents: (1) peer influence as the 
      primary driver of use; (2) cannabis exploration as the primary driver, which may be 
      enhanced in peer contexts; (3) social anxiety; and (4) negative peer experiences. 
      Identification of "neural targets" involved in motivating cannabis use may inform 
      clinicians about which treatment strategies work best in adolescents with cannabis 
      use problems, and via which social and neurocognitive processes.

TI  - Trends and correlates of cannabis use in pregnancy: a population-based study in 
      Ontario, Canada from 2012 to 2017.
PG  - 76-84
LID - 10.17269/s41997-018-0148-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Forthcoming legislative changes will legalize and make cannabis widely 
      available in Canada. We conducted an analysis of Ontario's birth registry to 
      determine recent trends and correlates of cannabis use in pregnancy. METHODS: We 
      conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study assembled from the Better 
      Outcomes Registry & Network (BORN) Ontario database, covering live births and 
      stillbirths in Ontario between April 2012 and December 2017. Trends in self-reported 
      cannabis use in pregnancy were analyzed according to maternal age and area-level 
      socio-economic status (SES) using log binomial regression analysis. RESULTS: A total 
      of 10,731 women reported cannabis use in pregnancy. Prevalence increased from 1.2% 
      in 2012 to 1.8% in 2017 (p-trend, < 0.001), equivalent to a relative increase of 61% 
      (relative risk [RR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51 to 1.72). The crude 
      prevalence of cannabis use in pregnancy among women aged 15 to 24 years and in the 
      lowest two area-level income quintiles was 6.7%, compared to 0.3% among women aged 
      35 years and over in the highest three income quintiles (RR 24.59, 95% CI 21.98 to 
      27.52). A majority (52.0%) of cannabis users were aged 15-24 years and 54.7% of 
      users were in the lowest two income quintiles. CONCLUSION: Cannabis use in pregnancy 
      has increased since 2012 in Ontario and was reported in about 2% of pregnancies in 
      2017. Increases were predominately among women of younger ages and those of lower 
      SES, and these groups account for half of users. Promoting cannabis cessation in 
      pregnancy could lead to improved perinatal and later childhood outcomes and reduce 
      health inequalities.

TI  - To Treat or Not to Treat? Polish Physicians' Opinions about the Clinical Aspects of 
      Cannabinoids-An Online Survey.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11010236 [doi]
LID - 236
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Medical cannabis' importance in Poland increased dramatically 
      following its legalization as the 12th country in Europe in 2017. However, no 
      studies have been published to give insight into Polish physicians' opinions about 
      medical cannabis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate physician's opinions about 
      cannabinoids' utility in clinical practice, concerns regarding their safety profile, 
      and their clinical experience with cannabinoids. METHODS: The survey using a 
      self-developed tool was conducted online; participants were physicians with or 
      without specialist training. Participation was voluntary. Physicians were recruited 
      through personal networks, palliative care courses, and Medical Chambers. RESULTS: 
      From June to October 2020, we recruited 173 physicians from 15/16 voivodeships. The 
      largest age group (43.9%; n = 76) was 30-39 year-olds. A similar proportion declared 
      they never used cannabis and did not receive any training regarding cannabinoids 
      (60% for both). Only 15 (8%) ever prescribed medical cannabis, although about 50% 
      declared knowing suitable patients for such therapy, and 53.8% had at least one 
      patient proactively asking for such treatment in the last 6 mo. The most common 
      indication chosen was pain: chronic cancer-related (n = 128), chronic non-cancer (n 
      = 77), and neuropathic (n = 60). Other commonly chosen conditions were alleviation 
      of cancer treatment side-effects (n = 56) and cachexia (n = 57). The overall safety 
      profile of THC was assessed as similar to most commonly used medications, including 
      opioids; NSAIDs and benzodiazepines were, however, perceived as safer. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Polish physicians favored the legalization of medical cannabis. However, it is of 
      concern that a limited number have any experience with prescribing cannabis. The 
      creation of clear guidelines to advise physicians in their routine practice and 
      education about pain management and the risks related to the consumption of 
      recreational cannabis for medical conditions are needed.

      Decidualization and Placentation.

AB  - Although the detrimental effects of cannabis consumption during gestation are known 
      for years, the vast majority of studies established a link between cannabis 
      consumption and foetal development. The complex maternal-foetal interrelationships 
      within the placental bed are essential for normal pregnancy, and decidua 
      definitively contributes to the success of this process. Nevertheless, the molecular 
      signalling network that coordinates strategies for successful decidualization and 
      placentation are not well understood. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system 
      highlighted new signalling mediators in various physiological processes, including 
      reproduction. It is known that endocannabinoids present regulatory functions during 
      blastocyst development, oviductal transport, and implantation. In addition, all the 
      endocannabinoid machinery was found to be expressed in decidual and placental 
      tissues. Additionally, endocannabinoid's plasmatic levels were found to fluctuate 
      during normal gestation and to induce decidual cell death and disturb normal 
      placental development. Moreover, aberrant endocannabinoid signalling during the 
      period of placental development has been associated with pregnancy disorders. It 
      indicates the existence of a possible regulatory role for these molecules during 
      decidualization and placentation processes, which are known to be particularly 
      vulnerable. In this review, the influence of the endocannabinoid system in these 
      critical processes is explored and discussed.

TI  - ADHD and cannabis use in young adults examined using fMRI of a Go/NoGo task.
PG  - 761-71
LID - 10.1007/s11682-015-9438-9 [doi]
AB  - Children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at 
      increased risk for substance abuse. Response inhibition is a hallmark of ADHD, yet 
      the combined effects of ADHD and regular substance use on neural networks associated 
      with response inhibition are unknown. Task-based functional Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging (fMRI) data from young adults with childhood ADHD with (n = 25) and without 
      (n = 25) cannabis use ≥ monthly in the past year were compared with a local 
      normative comparison group (LNCG) with (n = 11) and without (n = 12) cannabis use. 
      Go/NoGo behavioral and fMRI data were evaluated for main and interaction effects of 
      ADHD diagnosis and cannabis use. ADHD participants made significantly more 
      commission errors on NoGo trials than controls. ADHD participants also had less 
      frontoparietal and frontostriatal activity, independent of cannabis use. No main 
      effects of cannabis use on response inhibition or functional brain activation were 
      observed. An interaction of ADHD diagnosis and cannabis use was found in the right 
      hippocampus and cerebellar vermis, with increased recruitment of these regions in 
      cannabis-using controls during correct response inhibition. ADHD participants had 
      impaired response inhibition combined with less fronto-parietal/striatal activity, 
      regardless of cannabis use history. Cannabis use did not impact behavioral response 
      inhibition. Cannabis use was associated with hippocampal and cerebellar activation, 
      areas rich in cannabinoid receptors, in LNCG but not ADHD participants. This may 
      reflect recruitment of compensatory circuitry in cannabis using controls but not 
      ADHD participants. Future studies targeting hippocampal and cerebellar-dependent 
      function in these groups may provide further insight into how this circuitry is 
      altered by ADHD and cannabis use.

TI  - Social and structural factors associated with substance use within the support 
      network of adults living in precarious housing in a socially marginalized 
      neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada.
PG  - e0222611

LID - e0222611
AB  - BACKGROUND: The structure of a social network as well as peer behaviours are thought 
      to affect personal substance use. Where substance use may create health risks, 
      understanding the contribution of social networks to substance use may be valuable 
      for the design and implementation of harm reduction or other interventions. We 
      examined the social support network of people living in precarious housing in a 
      socially marginalized neighborhood of Vancouver, and analysed associations between 
      social network structure, personal substance use, and supporters' substance use. 
      METHODS: An ongoing, longitudinal study recruited 246 participants from four single 
      room occupancy hotels, with 201 providing social network information aligned with a 
      6-month observation period. Use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine (crack and 
      powder), methamphetamine, and heroin was recorded at monthly visits. Ego- and 
      graph-level measures were calculated; the dispersion and prevalence of substances in 
      the network was described. Logistic mixed effects models were used to estimate the 
      association between ego substance use and peer substance use. Permutation analysis 
      was done to test for randomness of substance use dispersion on the social network. 
      RESULTS: The network topology corresponded to residence (Hotel) with two clusters 
      differing in demographic characteristics (Cluster 1 -Hotel A: 94% of members, 
      Cluster 2 -Hotel B: 95% of members). Dispersion of substance use across the network 
      demonstrated differences according to network topology and specific substance. 
      Methamphetamine use (overall 12%) was almost entirely limited to Cluster 1, and 
      absent from Cluster 2. Different patterns were observed for other substances. 
      Overall, ego substance use did not differ over the six-month period of observation. 
      Ego heroin, cannabis, or crack cocaine use was associated with alter use of the same 
      substances. Ego methamphetamine, powder cocaine, or alcohol use was not associated 
      with alter use, with the exception for methamphetamine in a densely using part of 
      the network. For alters using multiple substances, cannabis use was associated with 
      lower ego heroin use, and lower ego crack cocaine use. Permutation analysis also 
      provided evidence that dispersion of substance use, and the association between ego 
      and alter use was not random for all substances. CONCLUSIONS: In a socially 
      marginalized neighborhood, social network topology was strongly influenced by 
      residence, and in turn was associated with type(s) of substance use. Associations 
      between personal use and supporter's use of a substance differed across substances. 
      These complex associations may merit consideration in the design of interventions to 
      reduce risk and harms associated with substance use in people living in precarious 
      housing.

TI  - Abuse or dependence on cannabis and other psychiatric disorders. Madrid study on 
      dual pathology prevalence.
PG  - 122-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cannabis use has been associated to a wide variety of mental disorders, 
      the possible causal role of this use in the etiology of severe mental disorders as 
      schizophrenia or bipolar disorder standing out. Moreover, the cannabinoid system is 
      involved in emotional regulation, so cannabis use could disturb this process and 
      provoke anxiety and mood disorders. The main objective of this study was to analyze 
      the cannabis addict subgroup from Madrid study of prevalence of dual disorders in 
      community mental health and substance misuse services. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      sample consisted of 837 outpatients under treatment in the mental health network or 
      drug network of the Community of Madrid (Spain). Of these, 353 subjects had a 
      lifetime diagnosis of cannabis abuse or dependence and 357 subjects did not have 
      cannabis substance use disorder. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
      Interview (MINI) to evaluate axis I mental disorders, and Personality Disorder 
      Questionnaire to evaluate personality disorders. RESULTS: It was considered that 
      76.5% of the cannabis addicts had a current dual disorder. The most prevalent ones 
      were mood and anxiety disorders. Of those addicted to cannabis, 51% had a 
      personality disorder. Most of them had several substance use disorders. Cannabis 
      abuse or dependence subjects had an earlier onset in consumption of other drugs such 
      as alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco than addicts without cannabis abuse or dependence. 
      The cannabis addicts also differed from the other addicts because of an association 
      to antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis and agoraphobia. The 
      presence of these mental disorders was significantly associated to a lower age at 
      initiation of cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Dual pathology is very high in cannabis 
      addicts under treatment. Said consumption of cannabis, probably within a 
      polysubstance use pattern, is associated to severe mental disorders as psychosis and 
      bipolar disorder. An earlier age of onset in cannabis use is associated to a greater 
      risk of said mental disorders.

TI  - Frequency of substance abuse among adolescents.
PG  - 265-9
LID - 10.5455/msm.2013.25.265-269 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug addiction is one of the most prominent problems in many countries 
      in transition, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. Age limit of drug addiction is 
      shifted to the younger age groups, especially is troubling the increase in number of 
      injection drug users. Our study was aimed to investigate the habits, attitudes and 
      practices related to drug use among young people from the area of Sarajevo city. We 
      can still feel the effects of the war, among which are the most important life 
      without closest relatives, banishment and various types of war and post-war trauma. 
      GOALS: To determine the frequency of substance abuse among adolescents; Identify 
      potentially relevant biological, psychological and socio economic characteristics of 
      the adolescents; To explore adolescents attitudes towards drug use; Examine the 
      general level of knowledge of adolescents about drugs and their effects. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: The study was conducted on randomized sample of 502 students in two 
      primary and three secondary schools in Sarajevo and Gracanica. To study used survey 
      method. Survey instrument was a self-made questionnaire with the research variables. 
      The obtained data were processed by a computer and statistically correlated. The 
      study is of combined, retrospective, prospective and transversal type. RESULTS: To 
      the question "How many times have you consumed cannabis in the last 30 days" about 
      6% of the respondents have tried once or twice, while 1.5% use it daily, ecstasy 
      have tried one or two times 2.25%, while 0.5% have daily use. Based on the obtained 
      results it can be concluded that students at schools in Sarajevo consumed drugs 50% 
      more than the children in Gracanica. Analyzing the age at which the subjects 
      consumed the drug for the first time, we came to the conclusion that in the third 
      year of high school only 8% of adolescents have tried any drugs before they turned 
      15 years. This percentage among eighth graders is about three times higher. 
      CONCLUSION: Presented research results clearly suggest a strong contamination of the 
      living environment of young people with different types of psychoactive substances. 
      Offer of drugs is extensive and distribution network covers all the places where 
      young people visits, including schools. It is clear that today's teenagers sooner or 
      later hear about drugs, see, get in touch with a "junkie" and have a chance to take 
      the drugs if they want to. From our research, we found that the following factors: 
      Marital status of parents, employment of parents, the number of family members, type 
      of school and satisfaction with oneself are not crucial for the eventual drug use 
      among young people. While, the biological status of the parents, educational status 
      of parents, financial status of parents, the tendency of parents tobacco and alcohol 
      use, adolescents' attitude to parents, the harmony of relationships between parents, 
      school performance, positive attitude toward the so-called light drugs, represent 
      significant risk factors for adolescent populations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cannabis use in Canada is becoming more prevalent across all 
      demographic groups due to increases in accessibility and lowered perceptions of 
      harm. These patterns are mirrored among women of reproductive age, including women 
      who are pregnant. Given increasing evidence for detrimental short- and long-term 
      impacts of cannabis exposure on fetal, newborn and child outcomes, there is a need 
      for high-quality, accessible resources providing reliable guidance and 
      recommendations on this topic for both the public and healthcare providers. We will 
      conduct a scoping review to identify and characterise all publicly available online 
      educational resources discussing cannabis use related to fertility, pregnancy and 
      breastfeeding developed by Canadian organisations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using 
      Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology as a guide, we will search Medline 
      (Ovid), Medline in Process (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ERIC (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) 
      and Education Source (EBSCOhost). We will also conduct a grey literature search 
      targeting the websites of national and independent Canadian obstetrical societies 
      and networks, and government and public health offices that provide recommendations 
      or guidance to individuals and their healthcare providers seeking information on 
      cannabis use related to fertility, pregnancy or breastfeeding. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is not required for scoping review studies. 
      We anticipate that this review's findings will be disseminated through traditional 
      channels, including preprint and peer-reviewed publications and presentations at 
      academic conferences. In addition, the resources and guidelines identified in the 
      study will be gathered and made available online on a single comprehensive public 
      repository. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION NUMBER: osf.io/p24y5.

AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate cognitive performance in a 
      first-episode psychosis sample, when stratifying the interaction by cannabis use and 
      familial or non-familial psychosis. Hierarchical-regression models were used to 
      analyse this association in a sample of 268 first-episode psychosis patients and 237 
      controls. We found that cannabis use was associated with worse working memory, 
      regardless of family history. However, cannabis use was clearly associated with 
      worse cognitive performance in patients with no family history of psychosis, in 
      cognitive domains including verbal memory, executive function and global cognitive 
      index, whereas cannabis users with a family history of psychosis performed better in 
      these domains. The main finding of the study is that there is an interaction between 
      cannabis use and a family history of psychosis in the areas of verbal memory, 
      executive function and global cognition: that is, cannabis use is associated with a 
      better performance in patients with a family history of psychosis and a worse 
      performance in those with no family history of psychosis. In order to confirm this 
      hypothesis, future research should explore the actual expression of the 
      endocannabinoid system in patients with and without a family history of psychosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Familial correlations underlie heritability estimates of psychosis. If 
      gene-environment interactions are important, familial correlation will vary as a 
      function of environmental exposure. METHODS: Associations between sibling and 
      parental schizotypy (n = 669 pairs, n = 1222 observations), and between sibling 
      schizotypy and patient CAPE psychosis (n = 978 pairs, n = 1723 observations) were 
      examined as a function of sibling cannabis use. This design is based on the 
      prediction that in unaffected siblings who are not exposed, vulnerability for 
      psychosis will remain latent, whereas in case of exposure, latent psychosis 
      vulnerability may become expressed, at the level of schizotypal symptoms, causing 
      the phenotypic correlation between relatives to become "visible" under the influence 
      of cannabis. RESULTS: Siblings exposed to recent cannabis use resembled their 
      patient-relative more closely in terms of positive schizotypy (urinalysis(+):B = 
      0.30, P<.001; urinalysis(-):B = 0.10, p<0.001; p-interaction = 0.0135). Similarly, 
      the familial correlation in positive schizotypy between parent and sibling was 
      significantly greater in siblings recently exposed to cannabis (urinalysis(+):B = 
      0.78, P<.001; urinalysis(-):B = 0.43, p<0.001; p interaction = 0.0017). Results were 
      comparable when using lifetime cannabis frequency of use as exposure instead of 
      recent use. Parental schizotypy did not predict cannabis use in the healthy sibling, 
      nor in the patient. Similarly, parental cannabis use was not associated with level 
      of schizotypy in the sibling, nor with psychotic symptoms in the patient, making 
      gene-environment correlation unlikely. CONCLUSION: Familial correlation of 
      psychosis-related experiences varies considerably as a function of exposure to 
      cannabis, confirming the importance of gene-cannabis interaction in shifts of 
      expression of psychosis-related experiences.

TI  - Emerging role of cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid receptor 1/cannabinoid

      management.

AB  - Cannabis was extensively utilized for its medicinal properties till the 19(th) 
      century. A steep decline in its medicinal usage was observed later due to its 
      emergence as an illegal recreational drug. Advances in technology and scientific 
      findings led to the discovery of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary 
      psychoactive compound of cannabis, that further led to the discovery of endogenous 
      cannabinoids system consisting of G-protein-coupled receptors - cannabinoid receptor 
      1 and cannabinoid receptor 2 along with their ligands, mainly anandamide and 
      2-arachidonoylglycerol. Endocannabinoid (EC) is shown to be a modulator not only for 
      physiological functions but also for the immune system, endocrine network, and 
      central nervous system. Medicinal research and meta-data analysis over the last few 
      decades have shown a significant potential for both THC and cannabidiol (CBD) to 
      exert palliative effects. People suffering from many forms of advanced stages of 
      cancers undergo chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting followed by severe and 
      chronic neuropathic pain and weight loss. THC and CBD exhibit effective analgesic, 
      anxiolytic, and appetite-stimulating effect on patients suffering from cancer. Drugs 
      currently available in the market to treat such chemotherapy-induced cancer-related 
      ailments are Sativex (GW Pharmaceutical), Dronabinol (Unimed Pharmaceuticals), and 
      Nabilone (Valeant Pharmaceuticals). Apart from exerting palliative effects, THC also 
      shows promising role in the treatment of cancer growth, neurodegenerative diseases 
      (multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease), and alcohol addiction and hence should 
      be exploited for potential benefits. The current review discusses the nature and 
      role of CB receptors, specific applications of cannabinoids, and major studies that 
      have assessed the role of cannabinoids in cancer management.

TI  - Patterns and correlates of cannabis use among individuals with HIV/AIDS in Maritime 
      Canada.
PG  - e1-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cannabis use in HIV-infected individuals is high and 
      its long-term effects are unclear. METHODS: The prevalence, perceived benefits and 
      consequences, and predictors of cannabis use were studied using a cross-sectional 
      survey in two immunodeficiency clinics in Maritime Canada. RESULTS: Current cannabis 
      use was identified in 38.5% (87 of 226) of participants. Almost all cannabis users 
      (85 of 87 [97.7%]) acknowledged its use for recreational purposes, with 21.8% (19 of 
      87) reporting medicinal cannabis use. The majority of patients enrolled in the 
      present study reported mild or no symptoms related to HIV (n=179). Overall, 80.5% 
      (70 of 87) of the cannabis-using participants reported a symptom-relieving benefit, 
      mostly for relief of stress, anorexia or pain. Participants consumed a mean (± SD) 
      of 18.3±21.1 g of cannabis per month and spent an average of $105.15±109.87 on 
      cannabis per month. Cannabis use was associated with rural residence, lower income 
      level, driving under the influence of a substance, and consumption of ecstasy and 
      tobacco. Income level, ecstasy use and tobacco use were retained as significant 
      predictors in regression modelling. Cannabis use was not associated with adverse 
      psychological outcomes. DISCUSSION: Prolonged previous cannabis consumption and the 
      substantial overlap between recreational and medicinal cannabis use highlight the 
      challenges in obtaining a tenable definition of medicinal cannabis therapy.

TI  - Acute and long-term cannabis use among stimulant users: Results from CTN-0037 
      Stimulant Reduction Intervention using Dosed Exercise (STRIDE) Randomized Control 
      Trial.

LID - S0376-8716(19)30138-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.02.032 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of vigorous intensity, high 
      dose exercise (DEI) on cannabis use among stimulant users compared to a health 
      education intervention (HEI) using data from the Stimulant Reduction Intervention 
      using Dosed Exercise, National Institute of Drug Abuse National Drug Treatment 
      Clinical Trials Network Protocol Number 0037 (STRIDE). METHODS: Adults (N = 302) 
      enrolled in the STRIDE randomized clinical trial were randomized to either the DEI 
      or the HEI. Interventions included supervised sessions three times a week during the 
      Acute phase (12 weeks) and once a week during the Follow-up phase (6 months). 
      Cannabis use was measured at each assessment via Timeline Follow Back and urine drug 
      screens. Cannabis use was compared between the groups during the Acute and Follow-up 
      phases using both the intent-to-treat sample and a complier average causal effects 
      (CACE) analysis. FINDINGS: Approximately 43% of the sample reported cannabis use at 
      baseline. The difference in cannabis use between the DEI and HEI groups during the 
      Acute phase was not significant. During the Follow-up phase, the days of cannabis 
      use was significantly lower among those in the DEI group (1.20 days) compared to the 
      HEI group (2.15 days; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: For those who adhered to the exercise 
      intervention, vigorous intensity, high dose exercise resulted in less cannabis use. 
      Results suggest that there were no significant short-term differences in cannabis 
      use between the groups. Further study on the long-term impact of exercise as a 
      treatment to reduce cannabis use should be considered.

      Long-term clinical, neuropsychological and functional differences.
PG  - e0183613
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0183613 [doi]
LID - e0183613
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies show the existence of a high prevalence of cannabis use 
      among patients with psychosis. However, the differences between men and women who 
      debut with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) regarding cannabis use have not been 
      largely explored. The aim of this study was to identify the specific sex factors and 
      differences in clinical evolution associated with cannabis use. METHOD: 
      Sociodemographic characteristics at baseline were considered in our sample of FEP 
      patients to find differences depending on sex and the use of cannabis. Clinical, 
      functional and neurocognitive variables at baseline, 1-year, and 3-years follow-up 
      were also explored. RESULTS: A total of 549 patients, of whom 43% (N = 236) were 
      cannabis users, 79% (N = 186) male and 21% (N = 50) female, were included in the 
      study. There was a clear relationship between being male and being a user of 
      cannabis (OR = 5.6). Cannabis users were younger at illness onset. Longitudinal 
      analysis showed that women significantly improved in all three dimensions of 
      psychotic symptoms, both in the subgroup of cannabis users and in the non-users 
      subgroup. Conversely, subgroups of men did not show improvement in the negative 
      dimension. In cognitive function, only men presented a significant time by group 
      interaction in processing speed, showing a greater improvement in the subgroup of 
      cannabis users. CONCLUSION: Despite knowing that there is a relationship between 
      cannabis use and psychosis, due to the high prevalence of cannabis use among male 
      FEP patients, the results showed that there were very few differences in clinical 
      and neurocognitive outcomes between men and women who used cannabis at the start of 
      treatment compared to those who did not.

AB  - Background Increased accessibility, recreational use, and regional legalization of 
      marijuana (cannabis) have been paralleled by widespread recognition of its serious 
      cardiovascular complications (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death) 
      particularly in the young. We aimed to examine trends in hospital admissions and 
      outcomes of adults with stress cardiomyopathy (SC) in temporal relation to marijuana 
      use. Methods and results A search of the 2003-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample 
      (NIIS) database identified 33,343 admissions for SC of which 210 (0.06%) were 
      temporally related to marijuana use. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and 
      outcomes of marijuana users (MU) and non-marijuana users (NMU) with SC were 
      compared. MU were younger (44±14 vs. 66±13 years), more often male (36% vs. 8%), and 
      had lower prevalence of hypertension (38% vs. 62%), diabetes (2.4% vs. 17.6%), and 
      hyperlipidemia (16% vs. 52%) while more often suffered from depression (33% vs. 
      15%), psychosis (12% vs. 4%), anxiety disorder (28% vs. 16%), alcohol use disorder 
      (13% vs. 3%), tobacco use (73% vs. 29%), and polysubstance abuse (11% vs. 0.3%) [all 
      p<0.001]. In addition, MU more often suffered a cardiac arrest and required 
      placement of a defibrillator while congestive heart failure was more frequent in 
      NMU. Logistic regression analysis on the entire database (n=71,753,900), adjusted 
      for known risk factors for SC, identified marijuana use as an independent predictor 
      of SC (OR=1.83; 95% CI=1.57-2.12, p<0.0001). Among MU, older age (>48 years) was a 
      strong predictor of any major adverse cardiac event (OR=7.8; 95% CI=2.88-21.13; 
      p<0.0001). Conclusions Marijuana use is linked to SC in younger individuals and is 
      associated with significant morbidity despite being younger in age and having a more 
      favorable cardiac risk factor profile in affected individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantifying cannabis use is complex due to a lack of a standardized 
      packaging system that contains specified amounts of constituents. A laboratory 
      procedure has been developed for estimating physical quantity of cannabis use by 
      utilizing a surrogate substance to represent cannabis, and weighing the amount of 
      the surrogate to determine typical use in grams. METHOD: This secondary analysis 
      utilized data from a multi-site, randomized, controlled pharmacological trial for 
      adult cannabis use disorder (N=300), sponsored by the National Drug Abuse Treatment 
      Clinical Trials Network, to test the incremental validity of this procedure. In 
      conjunction with the Timeline Followback, this physical scale-based procedure was 
      used to determine whether average grams per cannabis administration predicted urine 
      cannabinoid levels (11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and problems due to 
      use, after accounting for self-reported number of days used (in the past 30 days) 
      and number of administrations per day in a 12-week clinical trial for cannabis use 
      disorder. RESULTS: Likelihood ratio tests suggest that model fit was significantly 
      improved when grams per administration and relevant interactions were included in 
      the model predicting urine cannabinoid level (X(2)=98.3; p<0.05) and in the model 
      predicting problems due to cannabis use (X(2)=6.4; p<0.05), relative to a model that 
      contained only simpler measures of quantity and frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      provides support for the use of a scale-based method for quantifying cannabis use in 
      grams. This methodology may be useful when precise quantification is necessary 
      (e.g., measuring reduction in use in a clinical trial).

TI  - Non-specific lipid-transfer proteins: Allergen structure and function, 
      cross-reactivity, sensitization, and epidemiology.
PG  - e12010
LID - 10.1002/clt2.12010 [doi]
LID - e12010
AB  - BACKGROUND: Discovered and described 40 years ago, non-specific lipid transfer 
      proteins (nsLTP) are present in many plant species and play an important role 
      protecting plants from stressors such as heat or drought. In the last 20 years, 
      sensitization to nsLTP and consequent reactions to plant foods has become an 
      increasing concern. AIM: The aim of this paper is to review the evidence for the 
      structure and function of nsLTP allergens, and cross-reactivity, sensitization, and 
      epidemiology of nsLTP allergy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Task Force, supported by the 
      European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology (EAACI), reviewed current evidence 
      and provide a signpost for future research. The search terms for this paper were 
      "Non-specific Lipid Transfer Proteins", "LTP syndrome", "Pru p 3", "plant food 
      allergy", "pollen-food syndrome". RESULTS: Most nsLTP allergens have a highly 
      conserved structure stabilised by 4-disulphide bridges. Studies on the peach nsLTP, 
      Pru p 3, demonstrate that nsLTPs are very cross-reactive, with the four major IgE 
      epitopes of Pru p 3 being shared by nsLTP from other botanically related fruits. 
      These nsLTP allergens are to varying degrees resistant to heat and digestion, and 
      sensitization may occur through the oral, inhaled or cutaneous routes. In some 
      populations, Pru p 3 is the primary and sole sensitizing allergen, but many are 
      poly-sensitised both to botanically un-related nsLTP in foods, and non-food sources 
      of nsLTP such as Cannabis sativa, Platanus acerifolia, (plane tree), Ambrosia 
      artemisiifolia (ragweed) and Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort). Initially, nsLTP 
      sensitization appeared to be limited to Mediterranean countries, however more recent 
      studies suggest clinically relevant sensitization occurs in North Atlantic regions 
      and also countries in Northern Europe, with nsLTP sensitisation profiles being 
      broadly similar. DISCUSSION: These robust allergens have the potential to sensitize 
      and provoke symptoms to a large number of plant foods, including those which are 
      raw, cooked or processed. It is unknown why some sensitized individuals develop 
      clinical symptoms to foods whereas others do not, or indeed what other allergens 
      besides Pru p 3 may be primary sensitising allergens. It is clear that these 
      allergens are also relevant in non-Mediterranean populations and there needs to be 
      more recognition of this. CONCLUSION: Non-specific LTP allergens, present in a wide 
      variety of plant foods and pollens, are structurally robust and so may be present in 
      both raw and cooked foods. More studies are needed to understand routes of 
      sensitization and the world-wide prevalence of clinical symptoms associated with 
      sensitization to these complex allergens.

TI  - Individual and Network Factors Associated With Racial Disparities in HIV Among Young 
      Men Who Have Sex With Men: Results From the RADAR Cohort Study.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000001886 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual sexual risk behaviors have failed to explain the observed 
      racial disparity in HIV acquisition. To increase understanding of potential drivers 
      in disparities, we assessed differences across individual, network, and social 
      determinants. METHODS: Data come from RADAR (N = 1015), a longitudinal cohort study 
      of multilevel HIV-risk factors among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) aged 
      16-29 years in Chicago, IL. Data collection includes biological specimens; network 
      data, including detailed information about social, sexual, and drug-use networks; 
      and psychosocial characteristics of YMSM. RESULTS: Compared to white YMSM (24.8%) 
      and Hispanic YMSM (30.0%), black YMSM (33.9%) had a higher prevalence of both HIV 
      (32%; P < 0.001) and rectal sexually transmitted infections (26.5%; P = 0.011) with 
      no observed differences in pre-exposure prophylaxis use. Black YMSM reported lower 
      rates of sexual risk behaviors and more lifetime HIV tests (P < 0.001) compared with 
      all other YMSM; however, they were also significantly less likely to achieve viral 
      suppression (P = 0.01). Black YMSM reported the highest rate of cannabis use (P = 
      0.03) as well as greater levels of stigma (P < 0.001), victimization (P = 0.04), 
      trauma (P < 0.001), and childhood sexual abuse (P < 0.001). White YMSM reported 
      higher rates of depression (P < 0.001) and alcohol use (P < 0.001). In network 
      analyses, significant differences existed across network characteristics with black 
      YMSM having the lowest transitivity (P = 0.002), the highest density (P < 0.001), 
      and the highest homophily (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Black YMSM do not report higher 
      rates of HIV-risk behaviors, but social and network determinants are aligned toward 
      increased HIV risk. These results suggest that network interventions and those 
      addressing social determinants may help reduce disparities.

TI  - Sales and Advertising Channels of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS): Internet, 
      Social Networks, and Smartphone Apps.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci8070123 [doi]
LID - 123
AB  - In the last decade, the trend of drug consumption has completely changed, and 
      several new psychoactive substances (NPS) have appeared on the drug market as legal 
      alternatives to common drugs of abuse. Designed to reproduce the effects of illegal 
      substances like cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, or ketamine, NPS are only in part 
      controlled by UN conventions and represent an emerging threat to global public 
      health. The effects of NPS greatly differ from drug to drug and relatively scarce 
      information is available at present about their pharmacology and potential toxic 
      effects. Yet, compared to more traditional drugs, more dangerous short- and 
      long-term effects have been associated with their use, and hospitalizations and 
      fatal intoxications have also been reported after NPS use. In the era of 
      cyberculture, the Internet acts as an ideal platform to promote and market these 
      compounds, leading to a global phenomenon. Hidden by several aliases, these 
      substances are sold across the web, and information about consumption is shared by 
      online communities through drug fora, YouTube channels, social networks, and 
      smartphone applications (apps). This review intends to provide an overview and 
      analysis of social media that contribute to the popularity of NPS especially among 
      young people. The possibility of using the same channels responsible for their 
      growing diffusion to make users aware of the risks associated with NPS use is 
      proposed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in the composition and quantities of urine 
      peptides in regular cannabis users and nonusers by liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine specimens from healthy control 
      subjects and cannabis users were utilized to identify the differences in the number 
      and quantity of urine proteins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
      analysis. Significantly altered proteins were determined by a permutation testing 
      statistical method. Heat map, dendrogram, pathway, and network analyses were 
      performed to assess the degree of expression and the potential relationships between 
      proteins in both groups. RESULTS: A total of 1337 proteins were detected in both 
      groups with 19 proteins being significantly altered in cannabis users. Innate 
      immunity and carbohydrate metabolic pathways were highly linked with upregulated 
      proteins in the cannabis group. Additionally, 91 proteins were present and 46 
      proteins were absent only in cannabis users in comparison with the control cohort. 
      Our results suggest that regular use of cannabis is associated with significant 
      alterations in a number of urinary peptides, with a large number of proteins present 
      or absent only in cannabis users. Pathway analyses demonstrated an increased immune 
      response in cannabis users compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Our observations 
      potentially indicate activation (or inhibition) of specific signaling pathways in 
      the lower urinary tract during chronic exposure to exogenous cannabinoids. Our study 
      provides initial proteomic knowledge for future investigations on the potential role 
      of exocannabinoids in the development of intravesical therapies to treat lower 
      urinary tract disorders.

AB  - Alcohol and cannabis use disorder (AUD/CUD) are two of the most common addictive 
      disorders. While studies are beginning to understand the neural changes related to 
      acute and chronic use, few studies have examined the independent effects of AUD and 
      CUD on neural oscillatory activity. We examined 45 adults who reported current use 
      of both cannabis and alcohol. Participants underwent the SCID-V to determine whether 
      they met criteria for AUD and/or CUD. Participants also completed a visual-spatial 
      processing task while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG). ANCOVA with a 2 × 2 
      design was then used to identify the main effects of AUD and CUD on source-level 
      oscillatory activity. Of the 45 adults, 17 met criteria for AUD, and 26 met criteria 
      for CUD. All participants, including comparison groups, reported use of both 
      cannabis and alcohol. Statistical analyses showed a main effect of AUD, such that 
      participants with AUD displayed a blunted occipital alpha (8-16 Hz) response. 
      Post-hoc testing showed this decreased alpha response was related to increased AUD 
      symptoms, above and beyond amount of use. No effects of AUD or CUD were identified 
      in visual theta or gamma activity. In conclusion, AUD was associated with reduced 
      alpha responses and scaled with increasing severity, independent of CUD. These 
      findings indicate that alpha oscillatory activity may play an integral part in 
      networks affected by alcohol addiction.

AB  - Instagram is a highly visual social networking site whose audience continues to 
      grow, especially among young adults. In the present study, we examine 
      marijuana-related content on Instagram to better understand the varied types of 
      marijuana-related social networking occurring on this popular social media platform. 
      We collected 417,561 Instagram posts with marijuana-related hashtags from November 
      29 to December 12, 2014. We assessed content of a random sample (n = 5000) of these 
      posts with marijuana-related hashtags. Approximately 2136 (43 %) were explicit about 
      marijuana and further analyzed. Of the 2136 marijuana-related posts, images of 
      marijuana were common (n = 1568). Among these 1568 marijuana images, traditional 
      forms (i.e., buds/leaves) were the most common (63 %), followed by some novel forms 
      of marijuana, including marijuana concentrates (20 %). Among the 568 posts that 
      displayed marijuana being ingested, 20 % showed someone dabbing marijuana 
      concentrates. Marijuana-related advertisements were also observed among the 2136 
      marijuana-related posts (9 %). Our findings signal the promotion of marijuana use in 
      its traditional plant-based form; trendy and novel modes of marijuana ingestion were 
      also endorsed. This content along with the explicit marketing of marijuana that we 
      observed on Instagram have potential to influence social norms surrounding marijuana 
      use.

TI  - The mental health of young people who are not in education, employment, or training: 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1007/s00127-021-02212-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are increasing concerns about the intersection between NEET (not in 
      education, employment, or training) status and youth mental ill-health and substance 
      use. However, findings are inconsistent and differ across types of problems. This is 
      the first systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO-CRD42018087446) on the 
      association between NEET status and youth mental health and substance use problems. 
      METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycINFO, and ProQuest 
      Dissertations and Theses (1999-2020). Two reviewers extracted data and appraised 
      study quality using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We ran robust variance 
      estimation random-effects models for associations between NEET and aggregate groups 
      of mental ill-health and substance use measures; conventional random-effects models 
      for associations with individual mental/substance use problems; and subgroup 
      analyses to explore heterogeneity. RESULTS: We identified 24 studies from 6,120 
      references. NEET status was associated with aggregate groups of mental ill-health 
      (OR 1.28, CI 1.06-1.54), substance use problems (OR 1.43, CI 1.08-1.89), and 
      combined mental ill-health and substance use measures (OR 1.38, CI 1.15-1.64). Each 
      disaggregated measure was associated with NEET status [mood (OR 1.43, CI 1.21-1.70), 
      anxiety (OR 1.55, CI 1.07-2.24), behaviour problems (OR 1.49, CI 1.21-1.85), alcohol 
      use (OR 1.28, CI 1.24-1.46), cannabis use (OR 1.62, CI 1.07-2.46), drug use (OR 
      1.99, CI 1.19-3.31), suicidality (OR 2.84, CI 2.04-3.95); and psychological distress 
      (OR 1.10, CI 1.01-1.21)]. Longitudinal data indicated that aggregate measures of 
      mental health problems and of mental health and substance use problems (combined) 
      predicted being NEET later, while evidence for the inverse relationship was 
      equivocal and sparse. CONCLUSION: Our review provides evidence for meaningful, 
      significant associations between youth mental health and substance use problems and 
      being NEET. We, therefore, advocate for mental ill-health prevention and early 
      intervention and integrating vocational supports in youth mental healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Twitter represents a social media platform through which medical 
      cannabis dispensaries can rapidly promote and advertise a multitude of retail 
      products. Yet, to date, no studies have systematically evaluated Twitter behavior 
      among dispensaries and how these behaviors influence the formation of social 
      networks. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to characterize common cyberbehaviors and 
      shared follower networks among dispensaries operating in two large cannabis markets 
      in California. METHODS: From a targeted sample of 119 dispensaries in the San 
      Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles, we collected metadata from the 
      dispensary accounts using the Twitter API. For each city, we characterized the 
      network structure of dispensaries based upon shared followers, then empirically 
      derived communities with the Louvain modularity algorithm. Principal components 
      factor analysis was employed to reduce 12 Twitter measures into a more parsimonious 
      set of cyberbehavioral dimensions. Finally, quadratic discriminant analysis was 
      implemented to verify the ability of the extracted dimensions to classify 
      dispensaries into their derived communities. RESULTS: The modularity algorithm 
      yielded three communities in each city with distinct network structures. The 
      principal components factor analysis reduced the 12 cyberbehaviors into five 
      dimensions that encompassed account age, posting frequency, referencing, hyperlinks, 
      and user engagement among the dispensary accounts. In the quadratic discriminant 
      analysis, the dimensions correctly classified 75% (46/61) of the communities in the 
      San Francisco Bay Area and 71% (41/58) in Greater Los Angeles. CONCLUSIONS: The most 
      centralized and strongly connected dispensaries in both cities had newer accounts, 
      higher daily activity, more frequent user engagement, and increased usage of 
      embedded media, keywords, and hyperlinks. Measures derived from both network 
      structure and cyberbehavioral dimensions can serve as key contextual indicators for 
      the online surveillance of cannabis dispensaries and consumer markets over time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent study investigated the genetic associations and latent genetic 
      structure among eight psychiatric disorders using findings from genome-wide 
      association studies (GWASs). No data from substance use disorders were included, 
      while these represent an important category of mental disorders and could influence 
      the latent genetic structure. We extended the original paper by recreating the 
      genetic relationship matrix, graph, and latent genetic factor structure, including 
      additional data from substance use disorders. METHODS: We used GWAS summary 
      statistics of 11 psychiatric disorders, including alcohol dependence, nicotine 
      dependence, and cannabis use disorder. We estimated genetic correlations between all 
      traits in Linkage Disequilibrium-Score Regression. A graph was created to illustrate 
      the network of genetic correlations. We then used the genetic relationships to model 
      a latent genetic factor structure. RESULTS: Alcohol and nicotine dependence showed 
      significant genetic correlations with several other psychiatric disorders, including 
      ADHD, schizophrenia, and major depression. Cannabis use disorder was only 
      significantly associated with ADHD. The addition of substance use disorders resulted 
      in some changes in the latent structure of the factor model when compared to the 
      original model including eight disorders. All substance use disorders contributed 
      mostly to Factor 3, a heterogeneous factor with also loadings from ADHD, major 
      depression, Autism Spectrum Disorders, and Tourette Syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol 
      and nicotine dependence show widespread genetic correlations with other psychiatric 
      disorders. Including substance use disorders in the factor analysis results in some 
      changes in the underlying genetic factor structure. Given the instability of such 
      models, identified structures should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - The legalization of cannabis in Canada brings novel challenges across various 
      fronts, such as policy development, law enforcement, and public health and safety. 
      It is imperative to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and trends 
      surrounding cannabis use to develop efficacious methods of tackling these 
      challenges. Materials and Methods: Patients' breath collection was achieved using 
      the ExaBreath device from SensAbues. THC measurements in plasma and breath samples 
      were processed and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Discussion: We conducted a pragmatic 
      clinical trial on 23 medical cannabis patients, wherein we collected breath and 
      plasma samples intermittently for 4 hours after cannabis consumption. The research 
      participants consumed between 1 and 2 g of cannabis by either vaping, cannabis 
      cigarette, or concentrated wax (dabs) for 10 min. We used standardized laboratory 
      analytical techniques using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to 
      analyze both the breath and plasma sample. To analyze the data and find patterns, we 
      developed models using artificial neural network analysis. Conclusion: Our findings 
      show that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) breath concentrations peaked in 0.5 hours and 
      reached baseline levels after 2 hours in all the patients. We found an inverse 
      correlation between individuals' body mass index and their peak breath 
      concentrations, and an inverse relationship between age and peak breath 
      concentrations. Male participants had higher peak breath and plasma concentrations 
      than female participants. Our research provides new insight into the correlations 
      between breath and plasma THC concentrations in medical cannabis patients.

AB  - Whether the effects of cannabis use on brain function persist or recover following 
      abstinence remains unclear. Therefore, using meta-analytic techniques, we examined 
      whether functional alterations measured using fMRI persist in cannabis users 
      abstinent for over 25 days (or 600 h) as evidence suggests that the effects on 
      cognitive performance no longer persist beyond this period. Systematic literature 
      search identified 20 studies, of which, 12 examined current cannabis users (CCU) 
      (361 CCU versus 394 non-cannabis using controls (NU)) and 3 examined abstinent 
      cannabis users (ACU) in 5 separate comparisons (98 ACU versus 106 NU). Studies in 
      ACU were carried out in adolescents and suggest significantly greater activation in 
      components of the central executive and default mode networks in adolescent ACU 
      compared to NU. While this evidence is to be interpreted with caution because 
      studies were carried out in overlapping samples, they indicate a pressing need for 
      independent confirmation whether certain neurofunctional alterations in adolescent 
      cannabis users may persist even after cannabis and its metabolites are likely to 
      have left their bodies.

TI  - Distinct effects of childhood ADHD and cannabis use on brain functional architecture 
      in young adults.
PG  - 188-200
AB  - One of the most salient long-term implications of a childhood diagnosis of ADHD is 
      an increased risk for substance use, abuse, or dependence in adolescence and 
      adulthood. The extent to which cannabis use affects ADHD-related alterations in 
      brain functional organization is unknown, however. To address this research gap, we 
      recruited a sample of 75 individuals aged 21-25 years with and without a childhood 
      diagnosis of ADHD Combined Type, who were either frequent users or non-users of 
      cannabis. These participants have been followed longitudinally since age 7-9.9 years 
      as part of a large multi-site longitudinal study of ADHD, the Multimodal Treatment 
      Study of Children with ADHD (MTA). We examined task-independent intrinsic functional 
      connectivity (iFC) within 9 functional networks using a 2 × 2 design, which compared 
      four groups of participants: (1) individuals with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD who 
      currently use cannabis (n = 23); (2) individuals with ADHD who do not currently use 
      cannabis (n = 22); (3) comparisons who currently use cannabis (n = 15); and (4) 
      comparisons who do not currently use cannabis (n = 15). The main effects of 
      childhood ADHD were primarily weakened iFC in networks supporting executive function 
      and somatomotor control. Contrary to expectations, effects of cannabis use were 
      distinct from those of diagnostic group and no interactions were observed. 
      Exploratory brain-behavior analyses suggested that ADHD-related effects were 
      primarily linked with poorer neurocognitive performance. Deficits in the integrity 
      of functional networks supporting executive function and somatomotor control are 
      consistent with the phenotypic and neurocognitive features of ADHD. Our data suggest 
      that cannabis use does not exacerbate ADHD-related alterations, but this finding 
      awaits replication in a larger sample. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies are 
      urgently required to delineate the neurodevelopmental cascade that culminates in 
      positive and negative outcomes for those diagnosed with ADHD in childhood.

TI  - School, Friends, and Substance Use: Gender Differences on the Influence of Attitudes 
      Toward School and Close Friend Networks on Cannabis Involvement.
PG  - 138-146

AB  - The school environment is extremely salient in young adolescents' lives. Adolescents 
      who have unfavorable attitudes toward school and teachers are at elevated risk for 
      dropping out of school and engaging in behavioral health risks. Peer network 
      health-a summation of the positive and negative behaviors in which one's close 
      friend group engages-may be one way by which attitudes toward school exert influence 
      on youth substance use. Utilizing a sample of 248 primarily African-American young 
      urban adolescents, we tested a moderated mediation model to determine if the 
      indirect effect of attitude to school on cannabis involvement through peer network 
      health was conditioned on gender. Attitude toward school measured at baseline was 
      the predictor (X), peer network health measured at 6 months was the mediator (M), 
      cannabis involvement (including use, offers to use, and refusals to use) measured at 
      24 months was the outcome (Y), and gender was the moderator (W). Results indicated 
      that negative attitudes toward school were indirectly associated with increased 
      cannabis involvement through peer network health. This relationship was not 
      moderated by gender. Adolescents in our sample with negative attitudes toward school 
      were more likely to receive more offers to use cannabis and to use cannabis more 
      frequently through the perceived health behaviors of their close friends. 
      Implications from these results point to opportunities to leverage the dynamic 
      associations among school experiences, friends, and cannabis involvement, such as 
      offers and use.

AB  - HIV is associated with disruptions in cognition and brain function. Marijuana use is 
      highly prevalent in HIV but its effects on resting brain function in HIV are 
      unknown. Brain function can be characterized by brain activity that is correlated 
      between regions over time, called functional connectivity. Neuropsychiatric 
      disorders are increasingly being characterized by disruptions in such connectivity. 
      We examined the synergistic effects of HIV and marijuana use on functional 
      whole-brain network organization during resting state. Our sample included 78 adults 
      who differed on HIV and marijuana status (19 with co-occurring HIV and marijuana 
      use, 20 HIV-only, 17 marijuana-only, and 22 controls). We examined differences in 
      local and long-range brain network organization using eight graph theoretical 
      metrics: transitivity, local efficiency, within-module degree, modularity, global 
      efficiency, strength, betweenness, and participation coefficient. Local and 
      long-range connectivity were similar between the co-occurring HIV and marijuana use 
      and control groups. In contrast, the HIV-only and marijuana-only groups were both 
      associated with disruptions in brain network organization. These results suggest 
      that marijuana use in HIV may normalize disruptions in brain network organization 
      observed in persons with HIV. However, future work is needed to determine whether 
      this normalization is suggestive of a beneficial or detrimental effect of marijuana 
      on cognitive functioning in HIV.

AB  - Despite published treatment recommendations and the availability of approved and 
      off-label pharmacologic therapies for narcolepsy, the clinical management of this 
      incurable, chronic neurologic disorder remains challenging. While treatment is 
      generally symptomatically driven, decisions regarding which drug(s) to use need to 
      take into account a variety of factors that may affect adherence, efficacy, and 
      tolerability. Type 1 narcolepsy (predominantly excessive daytime sleepiness with 
      cataplexy) or type 2 narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness without cataplexy) may 
      drive treatment decisions, with consideration given either to a single drug that 
      targets multiple symptoms or to multiple drugs that each treat a specific symptom. 
      Other drug-related characteristics that affect drug choice are dosing regimens, 
      tolerability, and potential drug-drug interactions. Additionally, the patient should 
      be an active participant in treatment decisions, and the main symptomatic 
      complaints, treatment goals, psychosocial setting, and use of lifestyle substances 
      (ie, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and cannabis) need to be discussed with respect to 
      treatment decisions. Although there is a lack of narcolepsy-specific instruments for 
      monitoring therapeutic effects, clinically relevant subjective and objective 
      measures of daytime sleepiness (eg, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Maintenance of 
      Wakefulness Test) can be used to provide guidance on whether treatment goals are 
      being met. These considerations are discussed with the objective of providing 
      clinically relevant recommendations for making treatment decisions that can enhance 
      the effective management of patients with narcolepsy.

      A Social-Spatial Longitudinal Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An understudied, yet important area of youth development research is the 
      examination of how place affects critical psychosocial processes such as identity 
      formation, problem solving, emotional regulation, and in particular with 
      adolescents, belongingness, autonomy, social competency, and behavioral health. A 
      growing spatially informed literature indicates that youth interact with meaningful 
      places as environmental strategies, shaping developmental trajectories related to 
      behavioral health. OBJECTIVES: The objective is to investigate the relationship 
      between place preference and health behavior among adolescents, with a focus on 
      substance use behavior, specifically, cannabis use. We theorize that cannabis use is 
      associated with place preference for urban, city types of places, and that this 
      particular place preference interacts with close peer network behaviors. METHODS: To 
      understand the role of preferred locations, close peer relations, and mental health 
      on cannabis use, 248 adolescents (ages 13 to 14) were studied longitudinally. 
      Logistic regression models tested the moderating effects of peer network health (sum 
      of close friends risk and protective behaviors) on selecting city locations (urban 
      stress/neighborhoods) as preferred places, and subsequent cannabis use. RESULTS: 
      Results indicated that peer network health moderated the effects of choosing city 
      locations as favorite, increasing the odds of cannabis use more than eight-fold at 
      24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Favorite places located in city environments appear to 
      interact with peer risk behaviors influencing the cannabis use of young urban 
      adolescents, even after controlling for the influence of baseline cannabis use, 
      neighborhood disorder the home neighborhood, age, gender, and mental health effects.

      Use.

LID - 7466
AB  - Marijuana is the most commonly abused drug for military personnel tested at the Air 
      Force Drug Testing Laboratory. A publicly available dataset of drug use, personality 
      trait scores and demographic data was modeled with logistic regression, decision 
      tree and neural network models to determine the extent to which marijuana use can be 
      predicted using personality traits. While the logistic regression model had lower 
      performance than the neural network model, it matched the sensitivity of prior work 
      (0.80), achieved a high level of significance (p < 0.05) and yielded valuable 
      inferences. It implied that younger, less educated individuals who exhibit 
      sensation-seeking behavior and are open to experience tend to be at higher risk for 
      THC use. A method for performing an iterative multidimensional neural network 
      hyperparameter search is presented, and two iterations of a 6-dimensional search 
      were performed. Metrics were used to select a family of 8 promising models from a 
      cohort of 4600 models, and the best NN model's 0.87 sensitivity improved upon the 
      literature. The model met an f1 overfitting threshold on the test and holdout 
      datasets, and an accuracy sensitivity analysis on a holdout-equivalent dataset 
      yielded a 95% CI of 0.86 ± 0.04. These results have the potential to increase the 
      efficacy of drug prevention and intervention programs.

TI  - Cognitive Function in Individuals With Psychosis: Moderation by Adolescent Cannabis 
      Use.
PG  - 1496-1503
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbw030 [doi]
AB  - Prior cannabis use, compared to nonuse, is reported to be associated with less 
      cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The age of cannabis use and the persistent 
      influence of cannabis use on cognitive function has not been examined across the 
      psychosis dimension. Ninety-seven volunteers with psychosis (schizophrenia, 
      schizoaffective, or bipolar psychosis) and 64 controls were recruited at the Dallas 
      site of the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes consortium. 
      Cannabis use history obtained in a semi-structured manner was used to categorize 
      subjects into nonusers, adolescent-onset users, and late-onset users. The a priori 
      hypothesis tested was that individuals with psychosis and a history of adolescent 
      cannabis use (ACU) would have better global neuropsychological performance, as 
      measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) battery, 
      compared to those with psychosis and no cannabis use history. BACS Composite scores 
      were significantly higher in individuals with psychosis with ACU compared to 
      individuals with psychosis and no prior cannabis use. In subgroup analyses, ACU 
      influenced global cognition in the schizophrenia/schizoaffective (SCZ) subgroup but 
      not the bipolar psychosis subgroup. Exploratory analyses within the SCZ group, 
      suggest that ACU was associated with better performance in specific domains compared 
      to non-ACU groups. There are distinct associations between age of cannabis use and 
      neuropsychological function across psychotic illnesses. Specifically, ACU is 
      associated with better cognitive function in SCZ but not bipolar psychosis. This 
      age-dependent and diagnosis-specific influence of cannabis may need to be factored 
      into the design of future cognitive studies in SCZ.

TI  - Cannabis-induced basal-mid-left ventricular stress cardiomyopathy: A case report.
PG  - 49-52
LID - 10.4103/IJCIIS.IJCIIS_25_20 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis, popularly known as marijuana, is a recreational drug derived from the 
      plant Cannabis Sativa. It has been recognized as the most widely used mood-altering 
      substance in the world and is falsely perceived as a safe substance by the public at 
      large. This is mostly due to lack of awareness of its adverse effects as well as 
      successful attempts for legalization of its use in many states. We present a unique 
      case of a 56-year-old man who presented with neurological deficits concerning for 
      stroke. Soon after presentation, he required endotracheal intubation for airway 
      protection due to worsening mental status changes and pulmonary edema. 
      Echocardiogram revealed severe hypokinesis of the basal and mid-left ventricular 
      (LV) walls with hyperdynamic motion of the apex (reverse takotsubo). Coronary 
      angiography revealed no obstructive disease. Urine toxicology screen was positive 
      for Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The patient then stated to have used excess marijuana 
      before the symptom onset, while denying any recent emotional stressors. The findings 
      were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy (SC) triggered by marijuana use. 
      Myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arteriopathy have been increasingly 
      reported in younger individuals using marijuana. SC appears to be another unique 
      complication of marijuana use triggered through its effects on the autonomic nervous 
      and endocannabinoid systems.

TI  - Theta and Alpha Oscillatory Activity During Working Memory Maintenance in Long-Term 
      Cannabis Users: The Importance of the Polydrug Use Context.
PG  - 740277
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2021.740277 [doi]
LID - 740277
AB  - Background: Impairments in various subdomains of memory have been associated with 
      chronic cannabis use, but less is known about their neural underpinnings, especially 
      in the domain of the brain's oscillatory activity. Aims: To investigate neural 
      oscillatory activity supporting working memory (WM) in regular cannabis users and 
      non-using controls. We focused our analyses on frontal midline theta and posterior 
      alpha asymmetry as oscillatory fingerprints for the WM's maintenance process. 
      Methods: 30 non-using controls (CG) and 57 regular cannabis users-27 exclusive 
      cannabis users (CU) and 30 polydrug cannabis users (PU) completed a Sternberg 
      modified WM task with a concurrent electroencephalography recording. Theta, alpha 
      and beta frequency bands were examined during WM maintenance. Results: When compared 
      to non-using controls, the PU group displayed increased frontal midline theta (FMT) 
      power during WM maintenance, which was positively correlated with RT. The posterior 
      alpha asymmetry during the maintenance phase, on the other hand, was negatively 
      correlated with RT in the CU group. WM performance did not differ between groups. 
      Conclusions: Both groups of cannabis users (CU and PU), when compared to the control 
      group, displayed differences in oscillatory activity during WM maintenance, unique 
      for each group (in CU posterior alpha and in PU FMT correlated with performance). We 
      interpret those differences as a reflection of compensatory strategies, as there 
      were no differences between groups in task performance. Understanding the 
      psychophysiological processes in regular cannabis users may provide insight on how 
      chronic use may affect neural networks underlying cognitive processes, however, a 
      polydrug use context (i.e., combining cannabis with other illegal substances) seems 
      to be an important factor.

AB  - Increasing evidence supports a link between maternal prenatal cannabis use and 
      altered neural and physiological development of the child. However, whether cannabis 
      use relates to altered human brain development prior to birth, and specifically, 
      whether maternal prenatal cannabis use relates to connectivity of fetal functional 
      brain systems, remains an open question. The major objective of this study was to 
      identify whether maternal prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) is associated with 
      variation in human brain hippocampal functional connectivity prior to birth. 
      Prenatal drug toxicology and fetal fMRI data were available in a sample of 115 
      fetuses [43 % female; mean age 32.2 weeks (SD = 4.3)]. Voxelwise hippocampal 
      connectivity analysis in a subset of age and sex-matched fetuses revealed that PCE 
      was associated with alterations in fetal dorsolateral, medial and superior frontal, 
      insula, anterior temporal, and posterior cingulate connectivity. Classification of 
      group differences by age 5 outcomes suggest that compared to the non-PCE group, the 
      PCE group is more likely to have increased connectivity to regions associated with 
      less favorable outcomes and to have decreased connectivity to regions associated 
      with more favorable outcomes. This is preliminary evidence that altered fetal neural 
      connectome may contribute to neurobehavioral vulnerability observed in children 
      exposed to cannabis in utero.

TI  - Cannabis use by women during pregnancy does not influence infant DNA methylation of 
      the dopamine receptor DRD4.
PG  - 671-677
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2017.1314488 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal cannabis use in pregnancy is linked with long-term adverse 
      behavioral outcomes in offspring. Epigenetic processes established in utero that 
      affect dopaminergic (reward) signaling may mediate risks. Associations between 
      cannabis use and offspring DNA methylation have not been investigated; however, 
      maternal tobacco smoking in pregnancy is associated with distinct patterns of DNA 
      methylation at birth and beyond. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether maternal cannabis 
      use is associated with methylation of the dopamine receptor gene DRD4 promoter in 
      infants. METHODS: Mothers in the Triple B study provided detailed information on 
      drug use in each trimester of pregnancy. Buccal swabs were collected from neonates 
      at 8 weeks (n = 804, 51.7% male, and 48.3% female). DRD4 promoter DNA methylation 
      was measured using SEQUENOM MassARRAY. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of the women in the 
      study reported drug use during pregnancy, of whom 44 used cannabis. Of 19 
      cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) units tested in DRD4, gestational 
      cannabis use was associated with offspring methylation at 1 CpG unit in multivariate 
      models (β + 1.48, CI: 0.02 to 2.93, and p = 0.047). At another site there was weak 
      evidence that both cannabis and other drug use were independently associated with 
      increased methylation, while the association with tobacco was in the reverse 
      direction (cannabis use β + 0.67, CI: -0.12 to 1.46, and p = 0.09; other drug use β 
      + 1.11, CI: 0.17 to 2.05, and p = 0.02; tobacco use β -0.41, CI: -0.85 to 0.03, and 
      p = 0.07). None of the associations would remain significant after correction for 
      multiple testing. CONCLUSION: There is no strong evidence that maternal cannabis use 
      in pregnancy is associated with offspring DRD4 methylation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Repeated exposure to cannabis in nonpsychotic adolescents is associated 
      with impairments in executive control of attention, similar to those observed in 
      young adults with first-episode schizophrenia. To assess the impact of recurrent 
      exposure to cannabis on cognitive function, this study characterized attention 
      performance in both nonpsychotic adolescents and adolescents with early-onset 
      schizophrenia (EOS). METHOD: The Attention Network Test, a standard procedure that 
      estimates the functional state of neural networks controlling the efficiency of 
      three different attentional behaviors (alerting, orienting, and executive 
      attention), was administered to four groups of participants: (1) adolescents with 
      EOS and comorbid cannabis use disorder (EOS+CUD; n=18), (2) "Pure" schizophrenia 
      (EOS; n=34), (3) "Pure" cannabis use disorder (CUD; n=29), and (4) Healthy controls 
      (HC; n=53). Task performance was examined with a 2×2 design (EOS+ versus EOS- and 
      CUD+ versus CUD-) using multivariate analysis of covariance. Correlative analyses 
      were conducted between executive attention performance and measures of surface area 
      in the right anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: A significant EOS×CUD interaction 
      was observed. In the executive attention network, adolescents with EOS+CUD showed 
      reduced efficiency relative to adolescents with pure EOS, whereas no group 
      differences were found between adolescents with pure CUD and HC. Less efficient 
      executive attention was significantly associated with smaller surface area in the 
      right caudal anterior cingulate cortex in EOS+CUD. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary 
      data suggest that the presence of CUD has a moderating effect on attentional 
      performance in adolescents with schizophrenia compared to nonpsychotic adolescents. 
      These deficits could have a role in difficulties with self-regulation and 
      predisposition to substance misuse in this patient group. The anatomic substrate of 
      this cognitive deficit may be related to surface area in the right caudal anterior 
      cingulate cortex.

AB  - We investigated the relationships and diagnostic power of symptoms associated with 
      affective disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and drug addictions on Internet 
      use disorder. Moreover, we tested whether Internet use disorder is characterized by 
      a specific network of symptoms. One-hundred-and-four young adults (78 women) were 
      assessed in laboratory using self-report measures of Internet addiction, alcohol use 
      disorder, cannabis abuse, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, impulsiveness, 
      and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Only hoarding, obsessing, and depression symptoms 
      were positively linked to Internet use disorder severity, with hoarding having 
      greater power and accuracy than other obsessive-compulsive and affective symptoms. 
      Only individuals with mild-moderate Internet use disorder were characterized by a 
      network of strong and positive associations of affective and obsessive-compulsive 
      symptoms. These findings may encourage future longitudinal studies aimed at 
      identifying potential clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Internet use disorder 
      and treatment targets.

      Approach to Investigate the Mechanism of Key Genes and Therapeutic Traditional

AB  - BACKGROUND: To explore the potential target of depression and the mechanism of 
      related traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of depression. METHOD: 
      Differential gene expression in depression patients and controls was analyzed in the 
      GEO database. Key genes for depression were obtained by searching the disease 
      databases. The COREMINE Medical database was used to search for Chinese medicines 
      corresponding to the key genes in the treatment of depression, and the network 
      pharmacological analysis was performed on these Chinese medicines. Then, 
      protein-protein interaction analysis was conducted. Prediction of gene phenotypes 
      was based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      pathway enrichment scores. RESULTS: The total number of differentially expressed 
      genes in the GEO database was 147. Combined with the GEO dataset and disease 
      database, a total of 3533 depression-related genes were analyzed. After screening in 
      COREMINE Medical, it was found that the top 4 traditional Chinese medicines with the 
      highest frequency for depression were Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Crocus sativus L., 
      Bupleurum chinense DC., and Cannabis sativa L. The compound target network consisted 
      of 24 compounds and 138 corresponding targets, and the key targets involved PRKACA, 
      NCOA2, PPARA, and so on. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that the most commonly used 
      Chinese medicine could regulate multiple aspects of depression through these 
      targets, related to metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and neuroimmunity. 
      Prediction and analysis of protein-protein interactions resulted in the selection of 
      nine hub genes (ESR1, HSP90AA1, JUN, MAPK1, MAPK14, MAPK8, RB1, RELA, and TP53). In 
      addition, a total of four ingredients (petunidin, isorhamnetin, quercetin, and 
      luteolin) from this Chinese medicine could act on these hub genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      research revealed the complicated antidepressant mechanism of the most commonly used 
      Chinese medicines and also provided a rational strategy for revealing the complex 
      composition and function of Chinese herbal formulas.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the test-retest reliability, concurrent, convergent, and 
      discriminant validity of a recently devised screen (the Newton screen) for alcohol 
      and cannabis use/misuse, and its predictive validity at follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Adolescents, 12-17 years old (n = 4898), treated in 1 of 16 participating pediatric 
      emergency departments across the US were enrolled in a study as part of a larger 
      study within the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. Concurrent and 
      predictive validity (at 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up) were assessed in a random 
      subsample with a structured Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders-based interview. Convergent validity was assessed with the Alcohol Use 
      Disorders Identification, a widely used alcohol screening measure. RESULTS: The 
      sensitivity of the Newton screen for alcohol use disorder at baseline was 78.3% with 
      a specificity of 93.0%. The cannabis use question had a baseline sensitivity of 
      93.1% and specificity of 93.5% for cannabis use disorder. Predictive validity 
      analyses at 1, 2, and 3 years revealed high specificity but low sensitivity for 
      alcohol and high specificity and moderate sensitivity for cannabis. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      Newton screening instrument may be an appropriate brief screening tool for use in 
      the busy clinical environment. Specificity was high for both alcohol and cannabis, 
      but sensitivity was higher for cannabis than alcohol. Like other brief screens, more 
      detailed follow-up questions may be necessary to definitively assess substance 
      misuse risk and the need for referral to treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain and co-occurring disorders, such as sleep disorders, 
      anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders, are 
      among the most common conditions for which cannabis and cannabinoid-based products 
      derived from the cannabis plant (CBP) are used for therapeutic purposes. However, 
      healthcare providers report that they lack sufficient information on the risks, 
      benefits and appropriate use of cannabis and CBP derived from the cannabis plant for 
      therapeutic purposes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review of 
      studies investigating the use of cannabis and CBP derived from the cannabis plant 
      for the treatment of chronic pain and co-occurring conditions. Randomised controlled 
      trials, meta-analyses and observational studies will be prioritised. We will exclude 
      reviews of cannabinoid mechanisms of actions, commentary articles and narrative 
      reviews. The primary outcome of interest will be efficacy in relieving chronic pain. 
      Secondary outcomes will be efficacy in ameliorating conditions such as sleep 
      disorders, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use 
      disorders. We will search electronic bibliographic databases including Academic 
      Search Complete, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Evidence based Medicine 
      Reviewes, OVID Medline, PsychINFO, PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science. Two reviewers 
      will conduct screening and data collection independently. Study level of bias will 
      be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for randomised 
      controlled trials and non-randomised studies. Narrative analysis will be utilised to 
      interpret the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of this systematic review

AB  - Background: Cannabis is increasingly perceived as a harmless drug by recreational 
      users, yet chronic use may impact brain changes into adulthood. Repeated cannabis 
      exposure has been associated with enduring synaptic changes in executive control and 
      reward networks. It is important to determine whether there are brain functional 
      alterations within these networks in individuals that do not seek treatment for 
      chronic cannabis abuse. Methods: This longitudinal study compared resting-state 
      functional connectivity changes in executive control and reward networks between 23 
      non-treatment-seeking young adults with cannabis use disorder (6 females; baseline 
      age M = 19.3 ± 1.18) and 21 age-matched controls (10 females; baseline age M = 19.4 
      ± 0.65) to determine group differences in the temporal trajectories of resting-state 
      functional connectivity across a 2-year span. Results: Results showed i) significant 
      increases in resting-state functional connectivity between the caudal anterior 
      cingulate cortex and precentral and parietal regions over time in the control group, 
      but not in the cannabis use disorder group, and ii) sustained lower resting-state 
      functional connectivity of anterior cingulate cortex seeds with frontal and thalamic 
      regions in the cannabis use disorder group vs. the age-matched controls. 
      Resting-state functional connectivity strength was correlated with cannabis use 
      patterns in the cannabis use disorder sample. Conclusion: Longitudinal alterations 
      in intrinsic functional organization of executive control networks found in 
      non-treatment-seeking young adults with cannabis use disorder (when compared to 
      age-matched controls) may impact regulatory control over substance use behavior. 
      Current findings were limited to examining executive control and reward networks 
      seeded in ACC and NAcc, respectively. Future studies with larger sample sizes and 
      enough power are needed to conduct exploratory analyses examining rsFC of other 
      networks beyond those within the scope of the current study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is high prevalence of cigarette smoking in individuals with 
      first-episode psychosis (FEP) prior to psychosis onset. The purpose of the study was 
      to determine the impact of previous tobacco use with or without cannabis on first 
      psychotic experiences in FEP and the impact of this use on age of onset of symptoms, 
      including prodromes. METHODS: Retrospective analyses from the naturalistic, 
      longitudinal, multicentre, "Phenotype-Genotype and Environmental Interaction. 
      Application of a Predictive Model in First Psychotic Episodes (PEPs)" Study. The 
      authors analysed sociodemographic/clinical data of 284 FEP patients and 231 matched 
      healthy controls, and evaluated first psychotic experiences of patients using the 
      Symptom Onset in Schizophrenia Inventory. RESULTS: FEP patients had significantly 
      higher prevalence of tobacco, cannabis, and cocaine use than controls. The FEP group 
      with tobacco use only prior to onset (N = 56) had more sleep disturbances (42.9% vs 
      18.8%, P = 0.003) and lower prevalence of negative symptoms, specifically social 
      withdrawal (33.9% vs 58%, P = 0.007) than FEP with no substance use (N = 70), as 
      well as lower prevalence of ideas of reference (80.4% vs 92.4%, P = 0.015), 
      perceptual abnormalities (46.4% vs 67.4%, P = 0.006), hallucinations (55.4% vs 
      71.5%, P = 0.029), and disorganised thinking (41.1% vs 61.1%, P = 0.010) than FEP 
      group with previous tobacco and cannabis use (N = 144). FEP patients with cannabis 
      and tobacco use had lower age at first prodromal or psychotic symptom 
      (mean = 23.73 years [SD = 5.09]) versus those with tobacco use only (mean = 26.21 
      [SD = 4.80]) (P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The use of tobacco alone was not related to 
      earlier age of onset of a first psychotic experience, but the clinical profile of 
      FEP patients is different depending on previous tobacco use with or without 
      cannabis.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the differences in the consumption of alcohol, 
      tobacco and cannabis, mood and bullying between adolescents. A cross-sectional study 
      was carried out in five regions of Northern Spain (one in Galiza and four in central 
      Catalonia) that share similar socioeconomic characteristics and encompass around 
      10,000 inhabitants each. Students living in Burela, Galiza (N = 71) were compared to 
      those of Central Catalonia (N = 193). The independent variable was the municipality 
      of residence. The dependent variables encompassed: weekly available pocket money, 
      Family Affluence Scale, self-classified academic qualification, place of origin, 
      alcohol consumption, tobacco and cannabis smoking, negative mood and bullying. The 
      mean age and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of participants were similar 
      between the regions (Burela: 15.90 years (15.68-16.13) and Central Catalonia: 15.36 
      years (15.28-15.44)). More than half of the participants were females (Burela, 
      Galiza (53.5%) and Catalonia (54.9%)). Prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% CI were 
      estimated using Poisson regression models. In comparison with adolescents from 
      Burela (Galiza), those living in Central Catalonia had higher prevalence of diverse 
      academic levels (adjusted PR = 3.92 (1.78-8.66)), tobacco consumption (adjusted PR = 
      2.41 (1.47-3.97)) and negative mood (adjusted PR = 5.97 (3.05-11.70)). Even when 
      dealing with regions with similar socioeconomic characteristics and number of 
      inhabitants, differences exist in terms of the socioeconomic level, tobacco 
      consumption, mood and bullying, as reported by adolescents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine functional and structural neuroimaging correlates of 
      cognitive dysfunction associated with cannabis use in multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 20 subjects with MS who smoked cannabis and 19 
      noncannabis users with MS, matched on demographic and neurologic variables, 
      underwent fMRI while completing a test of working memory, the N-Back. Resting-state 
      fMRI and structural MRI data (lesion and normal-appearing brain tissue volumes, 
      diffusion tensor imaging metrics) were also collected. Neuropsychological data 
      pertaining to verbal (Selective Reminding Test Revised) and visual (10/36 Spatial 
      Recall Test) memory, information processing speed (Paced Auditory Serial Addition 
      Test [2- and 3-second versions] and Symbol Digit Modalities Test), and attention 
      (Word List Generation) were obtained. RESULTS: The cannabis group performed more 
      poorly on the more demanding of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test tasks (i.e., 
      2-second version) (p < 0.02) and the 10/36 Spatial Recall Test (p < 0.03). Cannabis 
      users had more diffuse cerebral activation across all N-Back trials and made more 
      errors on the 2-Back task (p < 0.006), during which they displayed increased 
      activation relative to nonusers in parietal (p < 0.007) and anterior cingulate (p < 
      0.001) regions implicated in working memory. No group differences in resting-state 
      networks or structural MRI variables were found. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS who 
      smoke cannabis are more cognitively impaired than nonusers. Cannabis further 
      compromises cerebral compensatory mechanisms, already faulty in MS. These imaging 
      data boost the construct validity of the neuropsychological findings and act as a 
      cautionary note to cannabis users and prescribers.

      substance use: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial among urban Native

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonmedical use of prescription opioids (defined as taking opioid 
      medications for hedonic effects or in a manner other than prescribed) and the use of 
      heroin have emerged in recent years as major public health concerns in the United 
      States. Of particular concern is the prevalence of opioid use among emerging adults 
      (ages 18-25), as this is a developmental period of heightened vulnerability and 
      critical social, neurological, and psychological development. Data from 2015 show 
      that American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have the highest rates of 
      diagnosis for opioid use disorders (OUDs). One recent study found that the overdose 
      death rate among urban-dwelling AI/AN individuals was 1.4 times higher compared to 
      those living in rural areas. To date, there are no evidence-based prevention 
      programs addressing opioid use among urban AI/AN emerging adults that integrate 
      culturally-appropriate strategies with evidence-based treatment. Traditions and 
      Connections for Urban Native Americans (TACUNA) builds on our prior work with AI/AN 
      communities across California to develop and evaluate culturally appropriate 
      programming to address opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use among urban AI/AN emerging 
      adults. METHODS/DESIGN: In a randomized controlled trial, 18-25 year old urban AI/AN 
      emerging adults will receive either TACUNA (n = 185), which comprises three virtual 
      workshops utilizing motivational interviewing, social network visualization, and 
      integrating traditional practices and a wellness circle, or one virtual culturally 
      sensitive opioid education workshop (n = 185). We will evaluate intervention effects 
      on primary outcomes of frequency of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use, as well as 
      secondary outcomes of social network characteristics and cultural connectedness, 
      over a 12-month period. DISCUSSION: This project has the potential to expand the 
      range and effectiveness of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis services for urban AI/AN 
      emerging adults by addressing the opioid epidemic and use of other substances at 
      both the community and individual level. In addition, it provides important 
      culturally grounded conceptual and practical information to advance the field of 
      substance use interventions and enhance resiliency among this population. TRIAL

TI  - Neuroprotective and Neuromodulatory Effects Induced by Cannabidiol and Cannabigerol 
      in Rat Hypo-E22 cells and Isolated Hypothalamus.
LID - 10.3390/antiox9010071 [doi]
LID - 71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) are non-psychotropic 
      terpenophenols isolated from Cannabis sativa, which, besides their 
      anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects, are able to inhibit, the first, and to 
      stimulate, the second, the appetite although there are no studies elucidating their 
      role in the hypothalamic appetite-regulating network. Consequently, the aim of the 
      present research is to investigate the role of CBD and CBG in regulating 
      hypothalamic neuromodulators. Comparative evaluations between oxidative stress and 
      food intake-modulating mediators were also performed. METHODS: Rat hypothalamic 
      Hypo-E22 cells and isolated tissues were exposed to either CBD or CBG, and the gene 
      expressions of neuropeptide (NP)Y, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and fatty acid amide 
      hydrolase were assessed. In parallel, the influence of CBD on the synthesis and 
      release of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) was evaluated. 
      The 3-hydroxykinurenine/kinurenic acid (3-HK/KA) ratio was also determined. RESULTS: 
      Both CBD and CBG inhibited NPY and POMC gene expression and decreased the 3-HK/KA 
      ratio in the hypothalamus. The same compounds also reduced hypothalamic NE synthesis 
      and DA release, whereas the sole CBD inhibited 5-HT synthesis. CONCLUSION: The CBD 
      modulates hypothalamic neuromodulators consistently with its anorexigenic role, 
      whereas the CBG effect on the same mediators suggests alternative mechanisms, 
      possibly involving peripheral pathways.

AB  - Previous studies have mostly shown positive effects of cannabis use on cognition in 
      patients with schizophrenia, which could reflect lower neurocognitive vulnerability. 
      There are however no studies comparing whether such cognitive differences have 
      neuronal correlates. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare whether 
      patients with previous cannabis use differ in brain activation from patients who has 
      never used cannabis. The patients groups were compared on the ability to up-regulate 
      an effort mode network during a cognitive task and down-regulate activation in the 
      same network during a task-absent condition. Task-present and task-absent brain 
      activation was measured by functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI). 
      Twenty-six patients with a DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia were grouped 
      into a previous cannabis user group and a no-cannabis group. An auditory dichotic 
      listening task with instructions of attention focus on either the right or left ear 
      stimulus was used to tap verbal processing, attention, and cognitive control, 
      calculated as an aggregate score. When comparing the two groups, there were 
      remaining activations in the task-present condition for the cannabis group, not seen 
      in the no-cannabis group, while there was remaining activation in the task-absent 
      condition for the no-cannabis group, not seen in the cannabis group. Thus, the 
      patients with previous cannabis use showed increased activation in an effort mode 
      network and decreased activation in the default mode network as compared to the 
      no-cannabis group. It is concluded that the present study show some differences in 
      brain activation to a cognitively challenging task between previous cannabis and 
      no-cannabis schizophrenia patients.

TI  - Functional connectivity in inhibitory control networks and severity of cannabis use 
      disorder.
PG  - 382-91
LID - 10.3109/00952990.2013.841710 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loss of control is a prominent feature of cannabis use disorders (CUD) 
      and involves orchestrated activity from several brain inhibitory control networks. 
      OBJECTIVES: In this study, we determined the associations between inhibitory control 
      network activation and connectivity and CUD severity. METHODS: To that end, we 
      compared cannabis-dependent (N = 44) vs. nondependent (N = 30) users during a Stop 
      Signal Task. First, we compared differences in neural response during response 
      inhibition via general linear model analysis within a priori regions of interest. 
      Second, we examined functional connectivity via psychophysiological interaction 
      (PPI) analysis between the right frontal control network (seed region) and 
      inhibitory control networks. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in network 
      activation between cannabis-dependent and nondependent users in any of the 
      inhibitory control networks. However, preliminary findings using the PPI analysis 
      showed that during successful response inhibition, cannabis-dependent users had 
      greater connectivity between right frontal control network and substantia 
      nigra/subthalamic nucleus (STN) network compared to nondependent users (small volume 
      correction, FWE-corrected p < 0.05). Further, multiple regression analyses on the 
      PPI maps showed modulatory effects of age of onset and quantity of cannabis use in 
      the nondependent users. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that 
      functional connectivity between frontal control and substantia nigra/STN networks 
      during response inhibition is sensitive to the effects of CUD severity unlike 
      behavioral task performance and neural activation in inhibitory control networks. 
      Further, modulators of this connectivity, such as onset and quantity of cannabis 
      use, show attenuated effects with progression of CUD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a primary component in the cannabis plant; however, 
      in recent years, interest in CBD treatments has outpaced scientific research and 
      regulatory advancement resulting in a confusing landscape of misinformation and 
      unsubstantiated health claims. Within the limited results from randomized controlled 
      trials, and lack of trust in product quality and known clinical guidelines and 
      dosages, real-world evidence (RWE) from countries with robust regulatory frameworks 
      may fill a critical need for patients and healthcare professionals. Despite growing 
      evidence and interest, no real-world data (RWD) studies have yet investigated 
      patients' reports of CBD impact on symptom control in the common expression of pain, 
      anxiety, depression, and poor wellbeing. The objective of this study is to assess 
      the impact of CBD-rich treatment on symptom burden, as measured with a specific 
      symptom assessment scale (ESAS-r). METHODS: This retrospective observational study 
      examined pain, anxiety, depression symptoms, and wellbeing in 279 participants over 
      18 years old, prescribed with CBD-rich treatment at a network of clinics dedicated 
      to medical cannabis in Quebec, Canada. Data were collected at baseline, 3 (FUP1), 
      and 6 (FUP2) month after treatment initiation. Groups were formed based on symptom 
      severity (mild vs moderate/severe) and based on changes to treatment plan at FUP1 
      (CBD vs THC:CBD). Two-way mixed ANOVAs were used to assess ESAS-r scores differences 
      between groups and between visits. RESULTS: All average ESAS-r scores decreased 
      between baseline and FUP1 (all ps < 0.003). The addition of 
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during the first follow-up had no effect on 
      symptom changes. Patients with moderate/severe symptoms experienced important 
      improvement at FUP1 (all ps < 0.001), whereas scores on pain, anxiety, and wellbeing 
      of those with mild symptoms actually increased. Differences in ESAS-r scores between 
      FUP1 and FUP2 were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: This retrospective 
      observational study suggests CBD-rich treatment has a beneficial impact on pain, 
      anxiety, and depression symptoms as well as overall wellbeing only for patients with 
      moderate to severe symptoms; however, no observed effect on mild symptoms. The 
      results of this study contribute to address the myths and misinformation about CBD 
      treatment and demand further investigation.

AB  - Introduction: Adolescent-onset cannabis use is rising in the era of marijuana 
      legalization. Recent imaging studies have identified neuroanatomical differences 
      between adult cannabis users and controls that are more prominent in early-onset 
      users. Other studies point to sex-dependent effects of cannabis. Methods: A 
      systematic review following PRISMA guidelines and subsequent effect-size seed-based 
      d mapping (SDM) meta-analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between 
      age (across the 12-to-21-year-old developmental window), sex, and gray matter volume 
      (GMV) differences between cannabis using (CU) and typically developing (TD) youth. 
      Results: Our search identified 1,326 citations, 24 of which were included in a 
      qualitative analysis. A total of 6 whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies 
      comparing regional GMV between 357 CU [mean (SD) age = 16.68 (1.28); 71% male] and 
      404 TD [mean (SD) age = 16.77 (1.36); 63% male] youth were included in the 
      SDM-meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of whole-brain VBM studies identified no regions 
      showing significant GMV difference between CU and TD youth. Meta-regressions showed 
      divergent effects of age and sex on cortical GMV differences in CU vs. TD youth. Age 
      effects were seen in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), with older-aged CU youth 
      showing decreased and younger-aged CU youth showing increased STG GMV compared to 
      age-matched TD youth. Parallel findings in the STG were also observed in relation to 
      duration of CU (years) in supplemental meta-regressions. Regarding sex effects, a 
      higher proportion of females in studies was associated with increased GMV in the 
      middle occipital gyrus in CU vs. TD youth. Conclusions: These findings suggest that 
      GMV differences between CU and TD youth, if present, are subtle, and may vary as a 
      function of age, cumulative cannabis exposure, and sex in young people. Whether age- 
      and sex-related GMV differences are attributable to common predispositional factors, 
      cannabis-induced neuroadaptive changes, or both warrant further investigation.

AB  - Background: Alcohol and cannabis are commonly used by adolescents in the United 
      States. Both alcohol use disorder (AUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) have been 
      associated with reduced emotion expression recognition ability. However, this work 
      has primarily occurred in adults and has not considered neuro-cognitive risk factors 
      associated with conduct problems that commonly co-occur with, and precede, substance 
      use. Yet, conduct problems are also associated with reduced emotion expression 
      recognition ability. The current study investigated the extent of negative 
      association between AUD and CUD symptom severity and expression recognition ability 
      over and above any association of expression recognition ability with conduct 
      problems [conduct disorder (CD) diagnostic status]. Methods: In this study, 152 
      youths aged 12.5-18 years (56 female; 60 diagnosed with CD) completed a rapid 
      presentation morphed intensity facial expression task to investigate the association 
      between relative severity of AUD/CUD and expression recognition ability. Results: 
      Cannabis use disorder identification test (CUDIT) scores were negatively associated 
      with recognition accuracy for higher intensity (particularly sad and fearful) 
      expressions while CD diagnostic status was independently negatively associated with 
      recognition of sad expressions. Alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) 
      scores were not significantly associated with expression recognition ability. 
      Conclusions: These data indicate that relative severity of CUD and CD diagnostic 
      status are statistically independently associated with reduced expression 
      recognition ability. On the basis of these data, we speculate that increased 
      cannabis use during adolescence may exacerbate a neuro-cognitive risk factor for the 
      emergence of aggression and antisocial behavior.

AB  - Cannabis and cannabinoids are implicated in multiple genotoxic, epigenotoxic and 
      chromosomal-toxic mechanisms and interact with several morphogenic pathways, likely 
      underpinning previous reports of links between cannabis and congenital anomalies and 
      heritable tumours. However the effects of cannabinoid genotoxicity have not been 
      assessed on whole populations and formal consideration of effects as a broadly 
      acting genotoxin remain unexplored. Our study addressed these knowledge gaps in USA 
      datasets. Cancer data from CDC, drug exposure data from National Survey of Drug Use 
      and Health 2003-2017 and congenital anomaly data from National Birth Defects 
      Prevention Network were used. We show that cannabis, THC cannabigerol and 
      cannabichromene exposure fulfill causal criteria towards first Principal Components 
      of both: (A) Down syndrome, Trisomies 18 and 13, Turner syndrome, Deletion 22q11.2, 
      and (B) thyroid, liver, breast and pancreatic cancers and acute myeloid leukaemia, 
      have mostly medium to large effect sizes, are robust to adjustment for ethnicity, 
      other drugs and income in inverse probability-weighted models, show prominent 
      non-linear effects, have 55/56 e-Values > 1.25, and are exacerbated by cannabis 
      liberalization (P = 9.67 × 10(-43), 2.66 × 10(-15)). The results confirm 
      experimental studies showing that cannabinoids are an important cause of 
      community-wide genotoxicity impacting both birth defect and cancer epidemiology at 
      the chromosomal hundred-megabase level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use rates are increasing among adults in the United States (US) 
      while the perception of harm is declining. This may result in an increased 
      prevalence of cannabis use disorder and the need for more clinical trials to 
      evaluate efficacious treatment strategies. Clinical trials are the gold standard for 
      evaluating treatment, yet study samples are rarely representative of the target 
      population. This finding has not yet been established for cannabis treatment trials. 
      This study compared demographic and cannabis use characteristics of a cannabis 
      cessation clinical trial sample (run through National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical 
      Trials Network) with three nationally representative datasets from the US; 1) 
      National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2) National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol 
      and Related Conditions-III, and 3) Treatment: Episodes Data Set - Admissions. 
      METHODS: Comparisons were made between the clinical trial sample and appropriate 
      cannabis using sub-samples from the national datasets, and propensity scores were 
      calculated to determine the degree of similarity between samples. RESULTS: showed 
      that the clinical trial sample was significantly different from all three national 
      datasets, with the clinical trial sample having greater representation among older 
      adults, African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, adults with more education, non-tobacco 
      users, and daily and almost daily cannabis users. CONCLUSIONS: These results are 
      consistent with previous studies of other substance use disorder populations and 
      extend sample representation issues to a cannabis use disorder population. This 
      illustrates the need to ensure representative samples within cannabis treatment 
      clinical trials to improve the generalizability of promising findings.

TI  - Mitochondrial COI Sequence Variations within and among Geographic Samples of the 
      Hemp Pest Psylliodes attenuata from China.
LID - 10.3390/insects11060370 [doi]
LID - 370
AB  - The hemp flea beetle Psylliodes attenuata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Psylliodes) is 
      a common pest of Cannabis sativa, including cultivars of both industrial hemp and 
      medicinal marijuana. Both the larval and adult stages of this beetle can cause 
      significant damages to C. sativa, resulting in substantial crop losses. At present, 
      little is known about the populations of this pest, including its genetic diversity. 
      In this study, we obtained 281 P. attenuata samples from nine field sites 
      representing broad industrial hemp productions in China and analyzed their DNA 
      sequences at the mitochondrial COI gene, the insect DNA barcode. Our analyses 
      revealed a total of 48 haplotypes, with 28 being found only in one specimen each 
      while the remaining 20 were shared by two or more specimens each. Of the 20 shared 
      haplotypes, eight were shared among local populations often from far away locations, 
      consistent with recent long-distance dispersals. However, the observed putative 
      long-distance dispersals have not obscured the significant genetic differentiations 
      among the regional populations from northeastern, eastern, central and southwestern 
      China. Interestingly, haplotype network analyses suggest evidence for potential 
      mitochondrial recombination in natural populations of this species. We briefly 
      discuss the implications of our results on its evolution, center of diversity, route 
      of spread, and pest management strategies in hemp fields.

AB  - This paper investigated how depressive symptoms moderate the role of peer cannabis 
      use on developmental patterns of individual cannabis use from adolescence to young 
      adulthood, controlling for a broad set of individual and family factors. Data from 
      two sources were analyzed separately: two saturated schools in the National 
      Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health Waves I-III (N=1550) covering 
      1994-2001; and three schools in the CARBIN study, covering 2012-2014. Discrete 
      mixture models identified developmental trajectories of cannabis use in each data 
      source, and logit models linked network and depressive symptom information to the 
      trajectories. Five similar cannabis use trajectories were identified in both 
      datasets: Nonuse, Low, Moderate, Increasing, and High. Peer cannabis use at baseline 
      predicted higher individual cannabis use trajectories, controlling for a wide range 
      of factors. However, the association between peer cannabis use and higher levels of 
      use (Moderate and High) attenuated as the adolescent's level of depressive symptoms 
      increased. Although these results may suggest that depression dampers adolescents' 
      susceptibility to peer influence, these results are also consistent with the notion 
      that depressed adolescents withdraw from their peer groups, distancing them from the 
      initial source of peer influence over time. The resulting isolation may place 
      adolescents at higher risk of adverse outcomes.

TI  - Premorbid Adjustment and IQ in Patients With First-Episode Psychosis: A Multisite 
      Case-Control Study of Their Relationship With Cannabis Use.
PG  - 517-529
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbz077 [doi]
AB  - Psychotic patients with a lifetime history of cannabis use generally show better 
      cognitive functioning than other psychotic patients. Some authors suggest that 
      cannabis-using patients may have been less cognitively impaired and less socially 
      withdrawn in their premorbid life. Using a dataset comprising 948 patients with 
      first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 1313 population controls across 6 countries, we 
      examined the extent to which IQ and both early academic (Academic Factor [AF]) and 
      social adjustment (Social Factor [SF]) are related to the lifetime frequency of 
      cannabis use in both patients and controls. We expected a higher IQ and a better 
      premorbid social adjustment in psychotic patients who had ever used cannabis 
      compared to patients without any history of use. We did not expect such differences 
      in controls. In both patients and controls, IQ was 3 points higher among 
      occasional-users than in never-users (mean difference [Mdiff] = 2.9, 95% CI = [1.2, 
      4.7]). Both cases and control daily-users had lower AF compared to occasional (Mdiff 
      = -0.3, 95% CI = [-0.5; -0.2]) and never-users (Mdiff = -0.4, 95% CI = [-0.6; 
      -0.2]). Finally, patient occasional (Mdiff = 0.3, 95% CI = [0.1; 0.5]) and 
      daily-users (Mdiff = 0.4, 95% CI = [0.2; 0.6]) had better SF than their never-using 
      counterparts. This difference was not present in controls (Fgroup*frequency(2, 2205) 
      = 4.995, P = .007). Our findings suggest that the better premorbid social 
      functioning of FEP with a history of cannabis use may have contributed to their 
      likelihood to begin using cannabis, exposing them to its reported risk-increasing 
      effects for Psychotic Disorders.

TI  - Testing the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in processing salient stimuli in 
      cannabis users: an rTMS study.
PG  - 2357-2369
LID - 10.1111/ejn.14194 [doi]
AB  - The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus are hubs in the default mode 
      network and play a role in processing external salient stimuli. Accordingly, 
      activation in these regions has been associated with response to salient stimuli 
      using drug cue-reactivity paradigms in substance using populations. These studies 
      suggest that the PCC and precuneus may underlie deficits in processing salient 
      stimuli that contribute toward the development of substance use disorders. The goal 
      of this study was to directly test this hypothesis using repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we 
      used rTMS to target the PCC and precuneus with a double-cone coil at 10 Hz (high 
      frequency) and 1 Hz (low frequency) in 10 adult cannabis users and 10 age- and 
      sex-matched non-using controls. Electroencephalography data were collected before 
      and after rTMS during a modified oddball paradigm with neutral, oddball, 
      self-relevant, and cannabis-related stimuli. Cannabis users exhibited increased 
      amplitude in P3 and faster latencies in the P3, N2, and P2 components in response to 
      self-relevant stimuli compared to controls during baseline that normalized after 
      rTMS. These results suggest that cannabis users exhibited heightened salience to 
      external self-relevant stimuli that were modulated after rTMS. PCC dysfunction in 
      cannabis users may be related to abnormalities in processing salient stimuli, such 
      those during cue-reactivity, and provides a potential target for cannabis use 
      disorder intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to determine the functional brain 
      correlates of information processing speed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who 
      smoke cannabis and those who are drug naïve. METHODS: Two neurologically and 
      demographically matched samples of MS patients were enrolled, those who smoked 
      cannabis daily (n = 20) and those who were cannabis naïve (n = 19). All participants 
      completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and underwent 
      fMRI testing during which they were administered a modified version of the Symbol 
      Digit Modalities Test (mSDMT). RESULTS: The cannabis group responded slower in nine 
      of 11 blocks of the mSDMT (p < 0.001), showing a trend toward a slower response time 
      (p < 0.08), but did not differ in the accuracy of response (p < 0.18). Both groups 
      displayed activation in a prefrontal cortex-parietal network associated with 
      information processing speed. When compared to the cannabis-naïve group, cannabis 
      users showed less activation in the right (p = 0.009) and left (p = 0.001) thalami 
      and increased activation in the anterior cingulate (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Regular 
      cannabis use in MS patients is associated with slower information processing speed 
      and a pattern of cerebral activity that differs from cannabis-naïve individuals, 
      most notably in a bilateral reduction of thalamic activity.

AB  - An increasing number of studies have implicated the role of network functional 
      connectivity in addiction. Yet, none have examined functional connectivity as a 
      potential mechanism of adolescent behavior change. We examined the underlying neural 
      mechanism of a promising treatment for adolescents, motivational interviewing (MI). 
      We began by employing psychophysiological interaction (PPI) to evaluate network 
      response in a sample of adolescent cannabis users (N=30). Next, we examined 
      correlations between network connectivity and clinical metrics of treatment outcome. 
      PPI analyses seeded on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) showed significant increases 
      in functional connectivity across the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), precentral 
      gyrus, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, supplementary motor area (SMA), 
      superior frontal gyrus, pallidus, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Further, 
      greater functional connectivity between the OFC and anterior cingulate/medial 
      frontal gyrus was associated with less behavior change (e.g., greater post-treatment 
      cannabis problems). These data support the role of the OFC network as a mechanism of 
      adolescent treatment response.

TI  - Exposure to and Content of Marijuana Product Reviews.

AB  - Many individuals now seek out product reviews in order to make an informed decision 
      prior to making a purchase. In this study, we investigate consumers' exposure to and 
      content within product reviews about marijuana because of their potential to shape 
      marijuana purchasing decisions. The terms "weed review," "marijuana review," and 
      "cannabis review" were searched on YouTube on June 10-11, 2015; the team viewed and 
      coded the content of 83 product review videos about marijuana. In addition, we 
      surveyed young adult (18-34 years old) current (past month) marijuana users 
      (n = 742) from across the USA online to assess exposure to product reviews about 
      marijuana and associations with socio-demographic characteristics and marijuana use 
      behaviors. In our content analysis of videos, we observed that the reviewers tended 
      to consume marijuana during the video and often shared personal, favorable 
      experiences towards the marijuana they ingested (e.g., became as high as possible or 
      experienced positive effects on physical and mental health). Most videos normalized 
      marijuana use and could be easily accessed by underage youth. About one third (34%) 
      of the survey participants viewed/sought a product review about marijuana in the 
      past 30 days. In a multivariable logistic regression model, living in a state where 
      recreational use is legal or using multiple forms of marijuana was associated with 
      increased odds of viewing/seeking marijuana reviews. Prevention messages should 
      counter product reviews about marijuana that tend to normalize and promote marijuana 
      use given that they are more readily viewed by individuals who are increasingly 
      susceptible to marijuana's potential harms.

TI  - "Redundancy" of endocannabinoid inactivation: new challenges and opportunities for 
      pain control.
PG  - 356-63
LID - 10.1021/cn300015x [doi]
AB  - Redundancy of metabolic pathways and molecular targets is a typical feature of all 
      lipid mediators, and endocannabinoids, which were originally defined as endogenous 
      agonists at cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors, are no exception. In particular, 
      the two most studied endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, are 
      inactivated through alternative biochemical routes, including hydrolysis and 
      oxidation, and more than one enzyme might be used even for the same type of 
      inactivating reaction. These enzymes also recognize as substrates other concurrent 
      lipid mediators, whereas, in turn, endocannabinoids might interact with 
      noncannabinoid receptors with subcellular distribution and ultimate biological 
      actions either similar to or completely different from those of cannabinoid 
      receptors. Even splicing variants of endocannabinoid hydrolyzing enzymes, such as 
      FAAH-1, might play distinct roles in endocannabinoid inactivation. Finally, the 
      products of endocannabinoid catabolism may have their own targets, with biological 
      roles different from those of cannabinoid receptors. These peculiarities of 
      endocannabinoid signaling have complicated the use of inhibitors of its inactivation 
      mechanisms as a safer and more efficacious alternative to the direct targeting of 
      cannabinoid receptors for the treatment of several pathological conditions, 
      including pain. However, new strategies, including the rediscovery of "dirty drugs", 
      and the use of certain natural products (including non-THC cannabis constituents), 
      are emerging that might allow us to make a virtue of necessity and exploit 
      endocannabinoid redundancy to develop new analgesics.

TI  - β-Caryophyllene Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits Angiogenesis in Colorectal Cancer 
      Models.
LID - 10.3390/ijms221910550 [doi]
LID - 10550
AB  - Beta-Caryophyllene (BCP), a naturally occurring sesquiterpene abundantly found in 
      cloves, hops, and cannabis, is the active candidate of a relatively new group of 
      vascular-inhibiting compounds that aim to block existing tumor blood vessels. 
      Previously, we have reported the anti-cancer properties of BCP by utilizing a series 
      of in-vitro anti-tumor-related assays using human colorectal carcinoma cells. The 
      present study aimed to investigate the effects of BCP on in-vitro, ex-vivo, and 
      in-vivo models of anti-angiogenic assays and evaluate its anti-cancer activity in 
      xenograft tumor (both ectopic and orthotopic) mice models of human colorectal 
      cancer. Computational structural analysis and an apoptosis antibody array were also 
      performed to understand the molecular players underlying this effect. BCP exhibited 
      strong anti-angiogenic activity by blocking the migration of endothelial cells, 
      tube-like network formation, suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells and sprouting of rat 
      aorta microvessels. BCP has a probable binding at Site#0 on the surface of VEGFR2. 
      Moreover, BCP significantly deformed the vascularization architecture compared to 
      the negative control in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay. BCP showed a 
      remarkable reduction in tumor size and fluorescence molecular tomography signal 
      intensity in all the mice treated with BCP, in a dose-dependent relationship, in 
      ectopic and orthotopic tumor xenograft models, respectively. The histological 
      analysis of the tumor from BCP-treated mice revealed a clear reduction of the 
      density of vascularization. In addition, BCP induced apoptosis through 
      downregulation of HSP60, HTRA, survivin, and XIAP, along with the upregulation of 
      p21 expressions. These results suggest that BCP acts at multiple stages of 
      angiogenesis and could be used as a promising therapeutic candidate to halt the 
      growth of colorectal tumor cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) do not always respond to 
      currently available treatments, and evaluation of new candidate pharmacotherapies is 
      indicated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an over-the-counter supplement, has shown promise 
      in treating a variety of substance use disorders, but little research has evaluated 
      its merits as a treatment for AUD. This secondary analysis from the National Drug 
      Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network examined the effects of NAC versus placebo 
      on alcohol use among participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD) enrolled in a 
      12-week, multi-site cannabis cessation trial. METHODS: Participants (N = 302, ages 
      18-50) were randomized to double-blind NAC (1200 mg, twice daily) or placebo. 
      Neither alcohol use nor desire for alcohol cessation were requirements for 
      participation. Participants that returned for at least one treatment visit and had 
      recorded alcohol use data (i.e., total drinks per week, drinking days per week, and 
      binge drinking days per week) were included in the analysis (n = 277). RESULTS: 
      Compared to the placebo group, participants in the NAC group had increased odds of 
      between-visit alcohol abstinence [OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.06-1.78; p = 0.019], fewer 
      drinks per week [RR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.48-0.99; p = 0.045], and fewer drinking days 
      per week [RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.51-0.92; p = 0.014]. Changes in concurrent cannabis 
      use amounts were not correlated to any of the alcohol use variables. DISCUSSION: 
      These findings indicate that NAC may be effective at reducing consumption of alcohol 
      by ∼30% among treatment-seeking adults with CUD, suggesting a need for further 
      trials focused on the effects of NAC on alcohol consumption among individuals 
      seeking treatment for AUD.

AB  - Large shifts in medical, recreational, and illicit cannabis consumption in the 
      United States have implications for personalizing treatment and prevention programs 
      to a wide variety of populations. As such, considerable research has investigated 
      clinical presentations of cannabis users in clinical and population-based samples. 
      Studies leveraging big data, social media, and social network analysis have emerged 
      as a promising mechanism to generate timely insights that can inform treatment and 
      prevention research. This study extends a novel method called stochastic block 
      modeling to derive communities of cannabis consumers as part of a complex social 
      network on Twitter. A set of examples illustrate how this method can ascertain 
      candidate samples of medical, recreational, and illicit cannabis users. Implications 
      for research planning, intervention design, and public health surveillance are 
      discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In addition to individual characteristics, there may be a wide range 
      of environmental or neighborhood stressors that contribute to elevated cannabis use 
      in groups of youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLHIV); however, the effects of social 
      disorganization on cannabis use in YLHIV to date have not been studied. METHODS: We 
      examined the effects of individual-level and neighborhood-level factors by 
      developing hierarchical generalized linear models estimating odds of current 
      cannabis use (any use during the past 3 months) and daily cannabis use among a 
      sample of YLHIV (N = 1921) currently receiving medical care. RESULTS: The final 
      model for daily cannabis use in the past 3 months included significant positive 
      effects associated with hostility (O.R. = 1.08, 95% C.I.: 1.05, 1.11), being older 
      (O.R. = 1.12, 95% C.I.: 1.05, 1.20), being a bisexual male (O.R. = 1.72, 95% C.I.: 
      1.10, 2.70), and residing in a community with a murder rate in the highest quartile 
      (O.R. = 1.91, 95% C.I.: 1.27, 2.87), second highest quartile (O.R. = 1.62, 95% C.I.: 
      1.06, 2.46), or third highest quartile (O.R. = 1.52, 95% C.I.: 1.01, 2.30). 
      DISCUSSION: This paper advances our knowledge of the multilevel factors associated 
      with elevated cannabis use among groups of YLHIV and furthers our understanding of 
      social and structural determinants of health in this population. Future research 
      into cannabis use among YLHIV should consider, not only cannabis use within the 
      context of the adjustment of living with HIV/AIDS, but also the stressors that 
      characterize the environments in which groups of YLHIV live.

TI  - Gender differences among treatment-seeking adults with cannabis use disorder: 
      Clinical profiles of women and men enrolled in the achieving cannabis 
      cessation-evaluating N-acetylcysteine treatment (ACCENT) study.
PG  - 136-144
LID - 10.1111/ajad.12503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence suggests that women may fare worse than 
      men in cannabis trials with pharmacologic interventions. Identifying baseline 
      clinical profiles of treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent adults could inform 
      gender-specific treatment planning and development. METHODS: The current study 
      compared baseline demographic, cannabis use, and psychiatric factors between women 
      (n = 86) and men (n = 216) entering the Achieving Cannabis Cessation-Evaluating 
      N-acetylcysteine Treatment (ACCENT) study, a multi-site, randomized controlled trial 
      conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. RESULTS: 
      Women reported greater withdrawal intensity (p = .001) and negative impact of 
      withdrawal (p = .001), predominantly due to physiological and mood symptoms. Women 
      were more likely to have lifetime panic disorder (p = .038) and current agoraphobia 
      (p = .022), and reported more days of poor physical health (p = .006) and 
      cannabis-related medical problems (p = .023). Women reporting chronic pain had 
      greater mean pain scores than men with chronic pain (p = .006). Men and women did 
      not differ on any measures of baseline cannabis use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cannabis-dependent women may present for treatment with more severe and impairing 
      withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric conditions compared to cannabis-dependent men. 
      This might help explain recent evidence suggesting that women fare worse than men in 
      cannabis treatment trials of pharmacologic interventions. Baseline clinical profiles 
      of treatment-seeking adults can inform gender-specific treatment planning and 
      development. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Cannabis-dependent women may benefit from 
      integrated treatment focusing on co-occurring psychiatric disorders and targeted 
      treatment of cannabis withdrawal syndrome.(Am J Addict 2017;26:136-144).

TI  - Substance Use and Addictive Behavior in Spanish Adolescents in Secondary School.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9020186 [doi]
LID - 186
AB  - The detection and prevention of addictive behaviour at an early age is essential 
      given the relationship between the age of the onset of consumption and the 
      appearance of addiction disorders. The aim of this study was to describe the 
      behavior related to substance use and addictive behaviors in adolescents at 
      secondary school from 12 to 16 years of age. A cross-sectional descriptive study has 
      been conducted. The prevalence of consumption of different addictive substances 
      (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine) and addictive behaviours (use of social 
      networks and video games) were collated, and the influence of the surrounding social 
      environment and risk perception were evaluated. The final sample was 1298 students. 
      Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use reflect the prevalence of last month's 
      consumption: 14% (11.8-15.6), 15% (13.4-17.4) and 3% (1.9-2.7) respectively. 76% of 
      the sample frequently use the Internet (5-7 days per week). There is a positive 
      association between the frequency of use and use in the immediate environment. The 
      relationships found show the need for educational and preventive intervention aimed 
      at parents and students that will allow them to know and effectively deal with 
      possible problems associated with the consumption of addictive substances.

TI  - The Impact of Combinations of Alcohol, Nicotine, and Cannabis on Dynamic Brain 
      Connectivity.
PG  - 877-890
LID - 10.1038/npp.2017.280 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis are among the most commonly used drugs. A prolonged 
      and combined use of these substances can alter normal brain wiring in different ways 
      depending on the consumed cocktail mixture. Brain connectivity alterations and their 
      change with time can be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
      because of its spatial and temporal content. Here, we estimated dynamic functional 
      network connectivity (dFNC) as derived from fMRI data to investigate the effects of 
      single or combined use of alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis. Data from 534 samples 
      were grouped according to their substance use combination as controls (CTR), smokers 
      (SMK), drinkers (DRN), smoking-and-drinking subjects (SAD), marijuana users (MAR), 
      smoking-and-marijuana users (SAM), marijuana-and-drinking users (MAD), and users of 
      all three substances (ALL). The DRN group tends to exhibit decreased connectivity 
      mainly in areas of sensorial and motor control, a result supported by the dFNC 
      outcome and the alcohol use disorder identification test. This trend dominated the 
      SAD group and in a weaker manner MAD and ALL. Nicotine consumers were characterized 
      by an increment of connectivity between dorsal striatum and sensorimotor areas. 
      Where possible, common and separate effects were identified and characterized by the 
      analysis of dFNC data. Results also suggest that a combination of cannabis and 
      nicotine have more contrasting effects on the brain than a single use of any of 
      these substances. On the other hand, marijuana and alcohol might follow an additive 
      effect trend. We concluded that all of the substances have an impact on brain 
      connectivity, but the effect differs depending on the dFNC state analyzed.

      self-regulatory action.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital e-cigarette marketing is largely unregulated and remains 
      easily accessible to young people. The growing public concern around youth JUUL use 
      and its viral presence on social media led the company to engage in several 
      voluntary actions to remove and reduce JUUL-related content on Instagram in May 
      2018. The current study examined how JUUL-related Instagram content changed in the 
      US following JUUL Labs' wave of voluntary actions in May 2018. METHODS: In 2019, we 
      collected a total of 50,817 JUUL-relevant posts by 16,323 unique users on Instagram 
      from March 1-May 15, 2018 (Phase 1) and May 16-November 11, 2018 (Phase II) using 
      the application programming interface. We conducted a semantic network analysis to 
      identify major topic clusters over time. RESULTS: Approximately 14,838 JUUL-related 
      posts were made by 5,201 accounts in Phase I and 35,979 posts were made by 11,122 
      accounts in Phase II. Major content clusters remained unchanged over time-key topics 
      were JUUL-related product characteristics and JUUL-communities; the general vape 
      community; and cannabis-related behavior. Of note, cannabis-related content grew in 
      Phase II, particularly use of the term CBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reflect the 
      limits of voluntary industry actions to reduce or change vaping-related content on 
      social media. Rather, strong federal restriction on commercial tobacco marketing is 
      the optimal pathway to reduce initial product marketing exposure among youth. These 
      limits would make the emergence and viral contagion of brand-related social media 
      content less likely and reduce its influence on youth behavior.

TI  - A single dose of cocaine enhances prospective memory performance.
PG  - 883-892
LID - 10.1177/0269881118783299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prospective memory is the ability to recall intended actions or events 
      at the right time or in the right context. While cannabis is known to impair 
      prospective memory, the acute effect of cocaine is unknown. In addition, it is not 
      clear whether changes in prospective memory represent specific alterations in memory 
      processing or result from more general effects on cognition that spread across 
      multiple domains such as arousal and attention. AIMS: The main objective of the 
      study was, therefore, to determine whether drug-induced changes in prospective 
      memory are memory specific or associated with more general drug-induced changes in 
      attention and arousal. METHODS: A placebo-controlled, three-way, cross-over study 
      including 15 regular poly-drug users was set up to test the influence of oral 
      cocaine (300 mg) and vaporised cannabis (300+150 'booster' µg/kg bodyweight) on an 
      event-based prospective memory task. Attentional performance was assessed using a 
      divided attention task and subjective arousal was assessed with the Profile of Mood 
      States questionnaire. RESULTS: Results showed that cocaine enhanced prospective 
      memory, attention and arousal. Mean performance of prospective memory and attention, 
      as well as levels of arousal were lowest during treatment with cannabis as compared 
      with placebo and cocaine as evinced by a significantly increased trend across 
      treatment conditions. Prospective memory performance was only weakly positively 
      associated to measures of attention and arousal. CONCLUSION: Together, these results 
      indicate that cocaine enhancement of prospective memory performance cannot be fully 
      explained by parallel changes in arousal and attention levels, and is likely to 
      represent a direct change in the neural network underlying prospective memory.

TI  - Recreational drug use in the Asia Pacific region: improvement in our understanding 
      of the problem through the UNODC programmes.
PG  - 295-9
LID - 10.1007/s13181-012-0240-4 [doi]
AB  - Until recently, there were limited data available on the epidemiology of 
      recreational drug use in the Asia Pacific region. However, in the last few years, a 
      number of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) programmes have improved 
      data collection networks, particularly in East and Southeast Asia. There are still 
      significant data gaps from some countries, including India and China, and data 
      reported from some countries in the region are based on expert estimates on 
      recreational drug use rather than formally collected data. However, the availability 
      of improved epidemiological data has enabled many countries in the region, both 
      individually and through regional UNODC programmes, to start to understand the 
      issues that need to be addressed. We will summarise in this mini-review the data 
      available within the UNODC World Drug Report and from the other UNODC programmes in 
      the region on the production and use of recreational drugs in the Asia Pacific 
      region.

TI  - Emotion regulation deficits in regular marijuana users.
PG  - 4270-4279
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23671 [doi]
AB  - Effective regulation of negative affective states has been associated with mental 
      health. Impaired regulation of negative affect represents a risk factor for 
      dysfunctional coping mechanisms such as drug use and thus could contribute to the 
      initiation and development of problematic substance use. This study investigated 
      behavioral and neural indices of emotion regulation in regular marijuana users 
      (n = 23) and demographically matched nonusing controls (n = 20) by means of an fMRI 
      cognitive emotion regulation (reappraisal) paradigm. Relative to nonusing controls, 
      marijuana users demonstrated increased neural activity in a bilateral frontal 
      network comprising precentral, middle cingulate, and supplementary motor regions 
      during reappraisal of negative affect (P < 0.05, FWE) and impaired emotion 
      regulation success on the behavioral level (P < 0.05). Amygdala-focused analyses 
      further revealed impaired amygdala downregulation in the context of decreased 
      amygdala-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity (P < 0.05, FWE) 
      during reappraisal in marijuana users relative to controls. Together, the present 
      findings could reflect an unsuccessful attempt of compensatory recruitment of 
      additional neural resources in the context of disrupted amygdala-prefrontal 
      interaction during volitional emotion regulation in marijuana users. As such, 
      impaired volitional regulation of negative affect might represent a consequence of, 
      or risk factor for, regular marijuana use. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4270-4279, 2017. © 2017

TI  - Use of cannabis during pregnancy and birth outcomes in an Aboriginal birth cohort: a 
      cross-sectional, population-based study.
PG  - e010286
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010286 [doi]
LID - e010286
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indigenous women continue to experience rates of stillbirth, preterm 
      birth and low birth weight, two to three times higher than other women in 
      high-income countries. The reasons for disparities are complex and multifactorial. 
      We aimed to assess the extent to which adverse birth outcomes are associated with 
      maternal cannabis use and exposure to stressful events and social health issues 
      during pregnancy. DESIGN/SETTING: Cross-sectional, population-based survey of women 
      giving birth to Aboriginal babies in South Australia, July 2011-June 2013. Data 
      include: maternal cannabis use, exposure to stressful events/social health issues, 
      infant birth weight and gestation. PARTICIPANTS: 344 eligible women with a mean age 
      of 25 years (range 15-43 years), enrolled in the study. Participants were 
      representative in relation to maternal age, infant birth weight and gestation. 
      RESULTS: 1 in 5 women (20.5%) used cannabis during pregnancy, and 52% smoked 
      cigarettes. Compared with mothers not using cannabis or cigarettes, mothers using 
      cannabis had babies on average 565 g lighter (95% CI -762 to -367), and were more 
      likely to have infants with a low birth weight (OR=6.5, 95% CI 3.0 to 14.3), and 
      small for gestational age (OR=3.8, 95% CI 1.9 to 7.6). Controlling for education and 
      other social characteristics, including stressful events/social health issues did 
      not alter the conclusion that mothers using cannabis experience a higher risk of 
      negative birth outcomes (adjusted OR for odds of low birth weight 3.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 
      11.2). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a compelling case for stronger efforts to 
      address the clustering of risk for adverse outcomes in Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
      Islander communities, and point to the need for antenatal care to address broader 
      social determinants of adverse perinatal outcomes. Integrated 
      responses--collaboratively developed with Aboriginal communities and 
      organisations--that focus on constellations of risk factors, and a holistic approach 
      to addressing social determinants of adverse birth outcomes, are required.

TI  - Water Extract from Inflorescences of Industrial Hemp Futura 75 Variety as a Source 
      of Anti-Inflammatory, Anti-Proliferative and Antimycotic Agents: Results from In 
      Silico, In Vitro and Ex Vivo Studies.
LID - 10.3390/antiox9050437 [doi]
LID - 437
AB  - Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa) is traditionally cultivated as a valuable source 
      of fibers and nutrients. Multiple studies also demonstrated antimicrobial, 
      anti-proliferative, phytotoxic and insecticide effects of the essential oil from 
      hemp female inflorescences. On the other side, only a few studies explored the 
      potential pharmacological application of polar extracts from inflorescences. In the 
      present study, we investigated the water extract from inflorescences of industrial 
      hemp Futura 75 variety, from phytochemical and pharmacological point of view. The 
      water extract was assayed for phenolic compound content, radical scavenger/reducing, 
      chelating and anti-tyrosinase effects. Through an ex vivo model of toxicity induced 
      by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on isolated rat colon and liver, we explored the extract 
      effects on serotonin, dopamine and kynurenine pathways and the production of 
      prostaglandin (PG)E(2). Anti-proliferative effects were also evaluated against human 
      colon cancer HCT116 cell line. Additionally, antimycotic effects were investigated 
      against Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, Microsporum gypseum. 
      Finally, in silico studies, including bioinformatics, network pharmacology and 
      docking approaches were conducted in order to predict the putative targets 
      underlying the observed pharmacological and microbiological effects. Futura 75 water 
      extract was able to blunt LPS-induced reduction of serotonin and increase of 
      dopamine and kynurenine turnover, in rat colon. Additionally, the reduction of 
      PGE(2) levels was observed in both colon and liver specimens, as well. The extract 
      inhibited the HCT116 cell viability, the growth of T. rubrum and T. interdigitale 
      and the activity of tyrosinase, in vitro, whereas in silico studies highlighting the 
      inhibitions of cyclooxygenase-1 (induced by carvacrol), carbonic anhydrase IX 
      (induced by chlorogenic acid and gallic acid) and lanosterol 14-α-demethylase 
      (induced by rutin) further support the observed pharmacological and antimycotic 
      effects. The present findings suggest female inflorescences from industrial hemp as 
      high quality by-products, thus representing promising sources of nutraceuticals and 
      cosmeceuticals against inflammatory and infectious diseases.

TI  - The continuity of effect of schizophrenia polygenic risk score and patterns of 
      cannabis use on transdiagnostic symptom dimensions at first-episode psychosis: 
      findings from the EU-GEI study.

AB  - Diagnostic categories do not completely reflect the heterogeneous expression of 
      psychosis. Using data from the EU-GEI study, we evaluated the impact of 
      schizophrenia polygenic risk score (SZ-PRS) and patterns of cannabis use on the 
      transdiagnostic expression of psychosis. We analysed first-episode psychosis 
      patients (FEP) and controls, generating transdiagnostic dimensions of psychotic 
      symptoms and experiences using item response bi-factor modelling. Linear regression 
      was used to test the associations between these dimensions and SZ-PRS, as well as 
      the combined effect of SZ-PRS and cannabis use on the dimensions of positive 
      psychotic symptoms and experiences. We found associations between SZ-PRS and (1) 
      both negative (B = 0.18; 95%CI 0.03-0.33) and positive (B = 0.19; 95%CI 0.03-0.35) 
      symptom dimensions in 617 FEP patients, regardless of their categorical diagnosis; 
      and (2) all the psychotic experience dimensions in 979 controls. We did not observe 
      associations between SZ-PRS and the general and affective dimensions in FEP. Daily 
      and current cannabis use were associated with the positive dimensions in FEP 
      (B = 0.31; 95%CI 0.11-0.52) and in controls (B = 0.26; 95%CI 0.06-0.46), over and 
      above SZ-PRS. We provide evidence that genetic liability to schizophrenia and 
      cannabis use map onto transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, supporting the validity 
      and utility of the dimensional representation of psychosis. In our sample, genetic 
      liability to schizophrenia correlated with more severe psychosis presentation, and 
      cannabis use conferred risk to positive symptomatology beyond the genetic risk. Our 
      findings support the hypothesis that psychotic experiences in the general population 
      have similar genetic substrates as clinical disorders.

TI  - A Network Approach to Environmental Impact in Psychotic Disorder: Brief Theoretical 
      Framework.
PG  - 870-3
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbw049 [doi]
AB  - The spectrum of psychotic disorder represents a multifactorial and heterogeneous 
      condition and is thought to result from a complex interplay between genetic and 
      environmental factors. In the current paper, we analyze this interplay using network 
      analysis, which has been recently proposed as a novel psychometric framework for the 
      study of mental disorders. Using general population data, we construct network 
      models for the relation between 3 environmental risk factors (cannabis use, 
      developmental trauma, and urban environment), dimensional measures of 
      psychopathology (anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobic anxiety, somatizations, and hostility), and a 
      composite measure of psychosis expression. Results indicate the existence of 
      specific paths between environmental factors and symptoms. These paths most often 
      involve cannabis use. In addition, the analyses suggest that symptom networks are 
      more strongly connected for people exposed to environmental risk factors, implying 
      that environmental exposure may lead to less resilient symptom networks.

TI  - Polysubstance use among youth experiencing homelessness: The role of trauma, mental 
      health, and social network composition.
PG  - 108228

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use is common among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). 
      However, less is known about the use of multiple substances (polysubstance use), or 
      factors associated with polysubstance use among YEH. The present study sought to 
      identify subgroups of YEH based on their recent polysubstance use behavior, and 
      investigate traumatic experiences, mental health and social network composition as 
      predictors. METHODS: YEH (N = 1,032; M(age) = 21.3) from three drop-in centers in 
      Los Angeles completed an in-person survey and social network interview between 
      October 2011 and June 2013. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify 
      subgroups of youth based on nine types of substance use in the past 30 days; latent 
      class logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with class 
      membership. RESULTS: Five polysubstance use classes were identified: heavy alcohol 
      and marijuana (33.6 %), illicit drug use (4.9 %), high all polysubstance use (14.9 
      %), primarily marijuana (18.1 %), and low use (28.5 %). Relative to the low use 
      class, traumatic experiences were associated with membership in every polysubstance 
      use class. Suicide attempts were associated with membership in the high all class 
      (OR = 9.41). Number of substance-using, homeless network members was associated with 
      membership in the heavy alcohol and marijuana use class (OR = 1.35). Number of 
      non-substance-using network members (homeless [OR = 0.29] and housed [OR = 0.73]) 
      was associated with lower odds of membership in the high all class. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Distinct groups of YEH can be identified by their recent polysubstance use patterns. 
      Traumatic experiences, suicidality, and social network composition are important 
      correlates of polysubstance use among YEH.

TI  - Neuroimaging meta-analysis of cannabis use studies reveals convergent functional 
      alterations in brain regions supporting cognitive control and reward processing.
PG  - 283-295
LID - 10.1177/0269881117744995 [doi]
AB  - Lagging behind rapid changes to state laws, societal views, and medical practice is 
      the scientific investigation of cannabis's impact on the human brain. While several 
      brain imaging studies have contributed important insight into neurobiological 
      alterations linked with cannabis use, our understanding remains limited. Here, we 
      sought to delineate those brain regions that consistently demonstrate functional 
      alterations among cannabis users versus non-users across neuroimaging studies using 
      the activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis framework. In ancillary analyses, 
      we characterized task-related brain networks that co-activate with cannabis-affected 
      regions using data archived in a large neuroimaging repository, and then determined 
      which psychological processes may be disrupted via functional decoding techniques. 
      When considering convergent alterations among users, decreased activation was 
      observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, which co-activated with frontal, 
      parietal, and limbic areas and was linked with cognitive control processes. 
      Similarly, decreased activation was observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 
      which co-activated with frontal and occipital areas and linked with 
      attention-related processes. Conversely, increased activation among users was 
      observed in the striatum, which co-activated with frontal, parietal, and other 
      limbic areas and linked with reward processing. These meta-analytic outcomes 
      indicate that cannabis use is linked with differential, region-specific effects 
      across the brain.

AB  - The Fourth Annual Symposium on Hidradenitis Suppurativa (SHSA) took place on 
      November 1-3, 2019, at the Westin Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit, Michigan. This 
      symposium was a joint meeting of the US Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation and the 
      Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation. This cross-disciplinary meeting with 
      experts from around the world was an opportunity to discuss the most recent advances 
      in the study of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) pathogenesis, clinical trials, 
      classification, scoring systems, complementary/alternative medical treatments, diet, 
      pain management, surgical and laser treatment, and ultrasonographic assessment. A 
      special preconference workshop was held on the use of neodymium-doped 
      yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser hair reduction, sinus tract deroofing, and carbon 
      dioxide laser excision with ultrasonographic mapping and tumescent anesthesia for 
      the treatment of HS. The focused workshops on establishing an HS clinic, setting up 
      an HS support group, the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Prospective Observational Registry 
      and Biospecimen Repository, and wound care were held during the meeting. A special 
      program called HS Ambassadors was established for patients who may have questions 
      about the conference presentations, and in addition, a meet and greet for patients 
      and HS Ambassadors was arranged. To facilitate networking between those early in 
      their careers and clinical and research experts, a mentoring reception was held.

TI  - Textile Hemp vs. Salinity: Insights from a Targeted Gene Expression Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/genes8100242 [doi]
LID - 242
AB  - Soil salinity is a serious threat to agriculture, because it compromises biomass 
      production and plant productivity, by negatively affecting the vegetative growth and 
      development of plants. Fiber crops like textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) are 
      important natural resources that provide, sustainably, both cellulosic and woody 
      fibers for industry. In this work, the response to salinity (200 mM NaCl) of a fiber 
      variety of hemp (Santhica 27) was studied using quantitative real-time PCR. The 
      responses of plantlets aged 15 days were analyzed by microscopy and by measuring the 
      changes in expression of cell wall-related genes, as well as in the general response 
      to exogenous constraints. The results presented here show that a different response 
      is present in the hemp hypocotyls and leaves. In the leaves, genes coding for heat 
      shock proteins were significantly upregulated, together with a phytohormone-related 
      transcript (ethylene-responsive factor 1 ERF1) and genes involved in secondary cell 
      wall biosynthesis (cellulose synthase CesA4, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins 
      FLA10 and FLA8). Moreover, a tendency towards upregulation was also observed in the 
      leaves for genes involved in lignification (4CL, CAD, PAL); a finding that suggests 
      growth arrest. In the hypocotyl, the genes involved in lignification did not show 
      changes in expression, while a gene related to expansion (expansin EXPA8), as well 
      as transcripts coding for calcium-dependent lipid-binding family proteins (CALB), 
      were upregulated. Microscopic analyses on the hypocotyl cross sections revealed 
      changes in the vascular tissues of salt-exposed plantlets, where the lumen of xylem 
      vessels was reduced. The gene expression results show that a different response is 
      present in the hemp hypocotyls and leaves. The data presented contribute to our 
      understanding of the regulatory gene network in response to salinity in different 
      tissues of an important fiber crop.

AB  - Only a few studies investigated changes in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) and 
      heated tobacco product (HTP) use during pandemic restrictions. We conducted a 
      web-based cross-sectional study of a representative sample of 6,003 Italian adults 
      during the strictest phase of the Covid-19 lockdown (April-May 2020). Participants 
      were asked to report changes in e-cigarette and HTP use compared to before the 
      pandemic. E-cigarette users increased from 8.1% to 9.1% and HTP users from 4.0% to 
      4.5%. Among e-cigarette non-users before lockdown, 1.8% started using e-cigarettes 
      during lockdown. New users were more frequently younger (p for trend 0.001), men 
      (odds ratio, OR 1.56; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.03-2.34), cannabis users (OR 
      2.35; 95% CI: 1.33-4.13), gamblers (OR 3.34; 95% CI: 2.18-5.11) and individuals with 
      anxiety symptoms (OR 1.58; 95% CI: 1.00-2.52). 1.0% of HTP non-users started using 
      it during lockdown. New users were less frequently current than never cigarette 
      smokers (OR 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.61) and more frequently gamblers (OR 2.23; 95% CI: 
      1.22-4.07). E-cigarettes and HTPs played little role as smoking cessation tools for 
      hardcore smokers but rather provided opportunities for young never smokers to engage 
      in socially acceptable activities, perhaps reflecting the obstacles they faced in 
      obtaining other addictive substances during confinement.

TI  - Functional connectivity in brain networks underlying cognitive control in chronic 
      cannabis users.
PG  - 1923-33
LID - 10.1038/npp.2012.39 [doi]
AB  - The long-term effect of regular cannabis use on brain function underlying cognitive 
      control remains equivocal. Cognitive control abilities are thought to have a major 
      role in everyday functioning, and their dysfunction has been implicated in the 
      maintenance of maladaptive drug-taking patterns. In this study, the Multi-Source 
      Interference Task was employed alongside functional magnetic resonance imaging and 
      psychophysiological interaction methods to investigate functional interactions 
      between brain regions underlying cognitive control. Current cannabis users with a 
      history of greater than 10 years of daily or near-daily cannabis smoking (n=21) were 
      compared with age, gender, and IQ-matched non-using controls (n=21). No differences 
      in behavioral performance or magnitude of task-related brain activations were 
      evident between the groups. However, greater connectivity between the prefrontal 
      cortex and the occipitoparietal cortex was evident in cannabis users, as compared 
      with controls, as cognitive control demands increased. The magnitude of this 
      connectivity was positively associated with age of onset and lifetime exposure to 
      cannabis. These findings suggest that brain regions responsible for coordinating 
      behavioral control have an increased influence on the direction and switching of 
      attention in cannabis users, and that these changes may have a compensatory role in 
      mitigating cannabis-related impairments in cognitive control or perceptual 
      processes.

TI  - Infodemiological Examination of Personal and Commercial Tweets About Cannabidiol: 
      Term and Sentiment Analysis.
PG  - e27307
LID - 10.2196/27307 [doi]
LID - e27307
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the absence of official clinical trial information, data from social 
      networks can be used by public health and medical researchers to assess public 
      claims about loosely regulated substances such as cannabidiol (CBD). For example, 
      this can be achieved by comparing the medical conditions targeted by those selling 
      CBD against the medical conditions patients commonly treat with CBD. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study was to provide a framework for public health and medical 
      researchers to use for identifying and analyzing the consumption and marketing of 
      unregulated substances. Specifically, we examined CBD, which is a substance that is 
      often presented to the public as medication despite complete evidence of efficacy 
      and safety. METHODS: We collected 567,850 tweets by searching Twitter with the 
      Tweepy Python package using the terms "CBD" and "cannabidiol." We trained two binary 
      text classifiers to create two corpora of 167,755 personal use and 143,322 
      commercial/sales tweets. Using medical, standard, and slang dictionaries, we 
      identified and compared the most frequently occurring medical conditions, symptoms, 
      side effects, body parts, and other substances referenced in both corpora. In 
      addition, to assess popular claims about the efficacy of CBD as a medical treatment 
      circulating on Twitter, we performed sentiment analysis via the VADER (Valence Aware 
      Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) model on the personal CBD tweets. RESULTS: We 
      found references to medically relevant terms that were unique to either personal or 
      commercial CBD tweet classes, as well as medically relevant terms that were common 
      to both classes. When we calculated the average sentiment scores for both personal 
      and commercial CBD tweets referencing at least one of 17 medical conditions/symptoms 
      terms, an overall positive sentiment was observed in both personal and commercial 
      CBD tweets. We observed instances of negative sentiment conveyed in personal CBD 
      tweets referencing autism, whereas CBD was also marketed multiple times as a 
      treatment for autism within commercial tweets. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed framework 
      provides a tool for public health and medical researchers to analyze the consumption 
      and marketing of unregulated substances on social networks. Our analysis showed that 
      most users of CBD are satisfied with it in regard to the condition that it is being 
      advertised for, with the exception of autism.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of lifetime cannabis use based on a large 
      meta-analytic sample of 32 330 subjects from the International Cannabis Consortium.

AB  - Cannabis is the most widely produced and consumed illicit psychoactive substance 
      worldwide. Occasional cannabis use can progress to frequent use, abuse and 
      dependence with all known adverse physical, psychological and social consequences. 
      Individual differences in cannabis initiation are heritable (40-48%). The 
      International Cannabis Consortium was established with the aim to identify genetic 
      risk variants of cannabis use. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide 
      association data of 13 cohorts (N=32 330) and four replication samples (N=5627). In 
      addition, we performed a gene-based test of association, estimated single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and explored the genetic correlation between 
      lifetime cannabis use and cigarette use using LD score regression. No individual 
      SNPs reached genome-wide significance. Nonetheless, gene-based tests identified four 
      genes significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use: NCAM1, CADM2, SCOC and 
      KCNT2. Previous studies reported associations of NCAM1 with cigarette smoking and 
      other substance use, and those of CADM2 with body mass index, processing speed and 
      autism disorders, which are phenotypes previously reported to be associated with 
      cannabis use. Furthermore, we showed that, combined across the genome, all common 
      SNPs explained 13-20% (P<0.001) of the liability of lifetime cannabis use. Finally, 
      there was a strong genetic correlation (rg=0.83; P=1.85 × 10(-8)) between lifetime 
      cannabis use and lifetime cigarette smoking implying that the SNP effect sizes of 
      the two traits are highly correlated. This is the largest meta-analysis of cannabis 
      GWA studies to date, revealing important new insights into the genetic pathways of 
      lifetime cannabis use. Future functional studies should explore the impact of the 
      identified genes on the biological mechanisms of cannabis use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) induces chronic haemolytic anaemia and 
      intermittent vaso-occlusion that results in tissue ischaemia causing acute, severe 
      pain episodes that can lead to frequent hospitalizations. These consequences can 
      have repercussions on family, social, school and/or professional life. Here, we 
      present some of the results of the PHEDRE study (Pharmacodépendance Et 
      DREpanocytose-drug dependence and sickle-cell disease), which is the largest study 
      of patients with SCD in France. This paper intends to describe characteristics of 
      the French SCD population. We also aimed to assess the impact of the disease on the 
      lives of patients using objective and subjective variables. METHODS: The PHEDRE 
      study was a national multicentric observational study. Adults, adolescents and 
      children with a confirmed SCD diagnosis were included in the study by their 
      referring doctor. Then, they were interviewed by phone about their socioeconomic 
      status, about the impact of the disease on their lives and about their analgesic and 
      psychoactive drug use. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 872 patients (28% 
      were minors). Seventy-two percent of adults were active, and all minors were in 
      school. Many patients presented criteria of severe SCD. Seventy-five percent were 
      homozygous SS, 15% were double heterozygotes SC and 8% were heterozygotes Sβthal, 
      87% received specific treatment, 58% were hospitalized at least once for 
      vaso-occlusive crisis in the past 12 months, and the number of analgesic drugs taken 
      averaged 3.8. Seventy-five percent of patients reported academic or professional 
      consequences related to their SCD, and 52% reported social consequences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The impact of SCD on patients' lives can be significant, nevertheless 
      their social integration seems to be maintained. We highlighted respect of 
      recommendations regarding analgesic treatments and only a few patients used tobacco, 
      alcohol or cannabis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials, NCT02580565;

AB  - Governments worldwide are increasingly concerned about the booming use of CBD 
      (cannabidiol) products. However, we know little about the impact of their 
      liberalization. We study a unique case of unintended liberalization of a CBD-based 
      product (light cannabis) that occurred in Italy in 2017. Using unique and 
      high-frequency data on prescription drug sales and by exploiting the staggered local 
      availability of the new product in each Italian province, we document a significant 
      substitution effect between light cannabis and anxiolytics, sedatives, opioids, 
      anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Results are informative for regulators and 
      suggest that bans on light cannabis use would disregard the needs of patients to 
      seek effective reliefs of their symptoms.

AB  - Tobacco and marijuana are some of the most common prenatal substance exposures 
      worldwide. The social acceptability and political landscape of marijuana and its 
      potency have changed dramatically in the last two decades leading to increased use 
      by pregnant women. Despite evidence for increasing marijuana use and high rates of 
      co-use of tobacco (TOB) and marijuana (MJ) during pregnancy, the impact of prenatal 
      exposure to each substance is typically studied in isolation. We investigated the 
      influence of co-exposure to TOB and MJ on infant neurobehavioral development over 
      the first postnatal month. Participants were 111 mother-infant pairs from a 
      low-income, diverse sample (Mean age = 25 ± 5; 54% minorities). TOB and MJ use were 
      assessed by Timeline Followback interview with biochemical confirmation. Three 
      groups were identified: (a) prenatal MJ + TOB, (b) prenatal TOB only, (c) controls. 
      Newborn neurobehavior was assessed at seven time points over the first postnatal 
      month using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale. MJ + TOB-exposed infants showed 
      decreased ability to self-soothe (Self-regulation) and attend to stimuli 
      (Attention), and increased need for examiner soothing (Handling) and low motor 
      activity (Lethargy) versus unexposed infants. Despite low levels of MJ use in 
      MJ + TOB co-users, co-exposure was associated with nearly double the impact on 
      infant self-soothing and need for examiner soothing versus TOB-exposure alone. 
      Effects of MJ + TOB co-exposure appeared more pronounced for daughters than for 
      sons. Although results are preliminary, they highlight additional risk from dual 
      exposure to MJ + TOB vs. TOB exposure alone, particularly for daughters. Results 
      also highlight the critical importance of investigating prenatal exposures in 
      concert and the need for intervention efforts to address MJ co-use in pregnant TOB 
      users.

AB  - Cannabis abuse during adolescence confers an increased risk for developing later in 
      life cognitive deficits reminiscent of those observed in schizophrenia, suggesting 
      common pathological mechanisms that remain poorly characterized. In line with 
      previous findings that revealed a role of 5-HT(6) receptor-operated mTOR activation 
      in cognitive deficits of rodent developmental models of schizophrenia, we show that 
      chronic administration of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to mice during adolescence 
      induces a long-lasting activation of mTOR in prefrontal cortex (PFC), alterations of 
      excitatory/inhibitory balance, intrinsic properties of layer V pyramidal neurons, 
      and long-term depression, as well as cognitive deficits in adulthood. All are 
      prevented by administrating a 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist or rapamycin, during 
      adolescence. In contrast, they are still present 2 weeks after the same treatments 
      delivered at the adult stage. Collectively, these findings suggest a role of 5-HT(6) 
      receptor-operated mTOR signaling in abnormalities of cortical network wiring 
      elicited by THC at a critical period of PFC maturation and highlight the potential 
      of 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists as early therapy to prevent cognitive symptom onset 
      in adolescent cannabis abusers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) is commonly used to manage symptoms in conditions and 
      diseases for which there is limited clinical research for its application. How 
      consumers arrive and decide to use CBD for medical treatment, despite lacking 
      clinical evidence, is largely unknown. In this paper, we seek to identify the 
      informational pathways through which consumers arrive at CBD for medical purposes. 
      METHODS: GoFundMe.com campaigns fundraising to purchase CBD between June 2017 and 
      May 2019 were collected using the Crowdfunding for Health Research Portal (CHRP). 
      Product descriptions were thematically analyzed to determine pathways leading to 
      incorporation of CBD into medical treatment. Campaign characteristics such as 
      fundraising ask, funding received, location, campaign title, description, Facebook 
      shares, and number of donors were recorded. Specific medical uses of CBD proposed in 
      campaigns were tabulated. RESULTS: The study identified 164 crowdfunding campaigns 
      primarily from the USA (n=159), with several from Canada (n=5). The campaigns 
      requested $2,219,284.24 (median, $7000) and raised $610,612.87 (median, $1805) from 
      6825 donors (median, 26). Many campaigns asked for other treatments or 
      illness-related costs not specific to CBD. The campaigns were shared 42,299 times on 
      Facebook (median, 156 shares). Three informational pathways were identified leading 
      to incorporation of CBD into medical treatment, which were self-directed research 
      (n=149), recommendations from a trusted care provider (n=36), and/or experiential 
      insights shared by someone associated with or influencing the crowdfunders personal 
      network (n=30). The proposed uses of CBD were for cancer (n=96), seizure-inducing 
      diseases/conditions (n=48), other/unspecified (n=6), joint/inflammatory diseases 
      (n=6), mental health disorders (n=3), nervous system diseases (n=3), and autoimmune 
      diseases (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that consumers crowdfunding come to 
      CBD through internally motivated reasons versus exposure to advertisements or other 
      forms of marketing. Campaign beneficiaries generally had an unmet medical need that 
      other forms of treatment were not satisfying. Then, through one or more of the 
      informational pathways identified, CBD is considered a potential solution.

AB  - In vitro seed germination is a useful tool for developing a variety of 
      biotechnologies, but cannabis has presented some challenges in uniformity and 
      germination time, presumably due to the disinfection procedure. Disinfection and 
      subsequent growth are influenced by many factors, such as media pH, temperature, as 
      well as the types and levels of contaminants and disinfectants, which contribute 
      independently and dynamically to system complexity and nonlinearity. Hence, 
      artificial intelligence models are well suited to model and optimize this dynamic 
      system. The current study was aimed to evaluate the effect of different types and 
      concentrations of disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide) and 
      immersion times on contamination frequency using the generalized regression neural 
      network (GRNN), a powerful artificial neural network (ANN). The GRNN model had high 
      prediction performance (R(2) > 0.91) in both training and testing. Moreover, a 
      genetic algorithm (GA) was subjected to the GRNN to find the optimal type and level 
      of disinfectants and immersion time to determine the best methods for contamination 
      reduction. According to the optimization process, 4.6% sodium hypochlorite along 
      with 0.008% hydrogen peroxide for 16.81 min would result in the best outcomes. The 
      results of a validation experiment demonstrated that this protocol resulted in 0% 
      contamination as predicted, but germination rates were low and sporadic. However, 
      using this sterilization protocol in combination with the scarification of in vitro 
      cannabis seed (seed tip removal) resulted in 0% contamination and 100% seed 
      germination within one week.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A quarter of pregnant women use alcohol, 6.5/1000 deliveries are 
      affected by opioid use disorder (OUD), and the prevalence of cannabis use in 
      pregnant women is increasing. However, marijuana co-exposure in polysubstance-using 
      women is not well described. METHODS: The well-characterized ENRICH-1 cohort 
      (n = 251), which focused on the effects of two primary exposures of interest-opioids 
      and alcohol, was used to (1) estimate the prevalence/frequency of marijuana use in 
      those with OUD and/or alcohol use, and (2) examined correlates of marijuana use. 
      Participants were classified into an OUD group (n = 125), Alcohol group (n = 69), 
      and concurrent OUD and Alcohol (OUD + Alcohol) group (n = 57). Self-report and 
      biomarkers ascertained substance use. Multivariable logistic regression identified 
      correlates of marijuana use. RESULTS: The prevalence of any marijuana use in 
      pregnancy was 43.2%, 52.6%, and 46.4% in the OUD, OUD + Alcohol, and Alcohol groups, 
      respectively. Correspondingly, weekly or daily use was reported by 19.4%, 21.0%, and 
      24.6% of participants. In the OUD and OUD + Alcohol groups, the proportion of women 
      using marijuana was significantly higher in those taking buprenorphine (45.8% and 
      58.3%, respectively) compared to women using methadone (37.5% and 42.9%, 
      respectively). Mean maternal age was lower in women who used marijuana in all three 
      groups compared to non-marijuana users. Independent correlates of marijuana use 
      (controlling for group, race/ethnicity, education, and smoking) were maternal age 
      (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) per 5-year increment 0.61; (95% CI 0.47, 0.79)), and 
      polysubstance use (aOR 2.02; 95% CI 1.11, 3.67). There was a significant interaction 
      between partnership status and group: among women who were not in a partnership, 
      those in the OUD and OUD + Alcohol groups had lower odds of marijuana use relative 
      to the Alcohol group. For women in the Alcohol group, partnered women had lower odds 
      of marijuana use than un-partnered women (aOR 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.68). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a relatively high prevalence and frequency of 
      marijuana use in pregnant women being treated for OUD and/or women consuming alcohol 
      while pregnant. These results highlight the need for ongoing risk reduction 
      strategies addressing marijuana use for pregnant women receiving OUD treatment and 
      those with alcohol exposure.

      Osteoarthritis: Role of Transient Receptor Potential Channels.

AB  - Systems pharmacology employs computational and mathematical methods to study the 
      network of interactions a drug may have within complex biological pathways. These 
      tools are well suited for research on multitarget drugs, such as natural compounds, 
      in diseases with complex etiologies, such as osteoarthritis (OA). The present study 
      focuses on cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive constituent of cannabis, targeting 
      over 60 distinct molecular targets as a potential treatment for OA, a degenerative 
      joint disease leading to chronic pain with a neuropathic component. We successfully 
      identified molecular targets of CBD that were relevant in the context of OA 
      treatment with both beneficial and detrimental effects. Our findings were confirmed 
      by in vivo and molecular studies. A key role of PPARγ in mediating the therapeutic 
      potential of CBD was revealed, whereas upregulation of multiple transient receptor 
      potential channels demasked CBD-induced heat hyperalgesia. Our findings pave the way 
      for novel CBD-based therapy with improved therapeutic potential but also encourage 
      the use of bioinformatic tools to predict the mechanism of action of CBD in 
      different conditions. We have also created an accessible web tool for analogous 
      analysis of CBD pharmacology in the context of any disease of interest and made it 
      publicly available.

TI  - Association of abnormal semantic processing with delusion-like ideation in frequent 
      cannabis users: an electrophysiological study.
PG  - 95-104
LID - 10.1007/s00213-012-2800-3 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Frequent cannabis use is a risk marker for schizophrenia and delusions, 
      but the neurocognitive mechanisms of this relationship remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: 
      We sought evidence that cannabis users have deficits in processing relationships 
      between meaningful stimuli, similar to abnormalities reported in schizophrenia, and 
      that these deficits are associated with delusion-like ideation. We used the N400 
      event-related brain potential (ERP) waveform as a neurophysiological probe of 
      activation of concepts in semantic memory. We hypothesized that cannabis users would 
      exhibit larger (more negative) than normal N400 amplitudes in response to stimuli 
      meaningfully related to a preceding prime-reflecting deficient activation of 
      concepts related to the prime. We further hypothesized that the magnitude of this 
      abnormality would correlate with severity of delusion-like ideation. METHODS: We 
      recorded ERPs in 24 frequent cannabis users and 24 non-using comparison participants 
      who viewed prime words followed by targets which were either words related or 
      unrelated to the prime or pronounceable nonwords. The participants' task was to 
      indicate whether the target was a word. Delusion-like ideation was measured via the 
      Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, cannabis 
      users exhibited smaller than normal N400s to both related and unrelated targets. 
      These abnormalities correlated with delusion-like ideation in cannabis users only. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with a generalized abnormality of activation 
      within semantic memory neural networks in cannabis users. Further research is needed 
      to investigate whether such an abnormality plays a role in the development of 
      delusion-like ideation in cannabis users.

TI  - Social disadvantage, linguistic distance, ethnic minority status and first-episode 
      psychosis: results from the EU-GEI case-control study.
PG  - 1536-1548
LID - 10.1017/S003329172000029X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethnic minority groups in Western countries face an increased risk of 
      psychotic disorders. Causes of this long-standing public health inequality remain 
      poorly understood. We investigated whether social disadvantage, linguistic distance 
      and discrimination contributed to these patterns. METHODS: We used case-control data 
      from the EUropean network of national schizophrenia networks studying 
      Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) study, carried out in 16 centres in six 
      countries. We recruited 1130 cases and 1497 population-based controls. Our main 
      outcome measure was first-episode ICD-10 psychotic disorder (F20-F33), and exposures 
      were ethnicity (white majority, black, mixed, Asian, North-African, white minority 
      and other), generational status, social disadvantage, linguistic distance and 
      discrimination. Age, sex, paternal age, cannabis use, childhood trauma and parental 
      history of psychosis were included as a priori confounders. Exposures and 
      confounders were added sequentially to multivariable logistic models, following 
      multiple imputation for missing data. RESULTS: Participants from any ethnic minority 
      background had crude excess odds of psychosis [odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.69-2.43], which remained after adjustment for confounders (OR 1.61, 
      95% CI 1.31-1.98). This was progressively attenuated following further adjustment 
      for social disadvantage (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22-1.89) and linguistic distance (OR 
      1.22, 95% CI 0.95-1.57), a pattern mirrored in several specific ethnic groups. 
      Linguistic distance and social disadvantage had stronger effects for first- and 
      later-generation groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Social disadvantage and 
      linguistic distance, two potential markers of sociocultural exclusion, were 
      associated with increased odds of psychotic disorder, and adjusting for these led to 
      equivocal risk between several ethnic minority groups and the white majority.

AB  - Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug, however its effects on cognitive 
      functions underlying safe driving remain mostly unexplored. Our goal was to evaluate 
      the impact of cannabis on the driving ability of occasional smokers, by 
      investigating changes in the brain network involved in a tracking task. The subject 
      characteristics, the percentage of Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol in the joint, and the 
      inhaled dose were in accordance with real-life conditions. Thirty-one male 
      volunteers were enrolled in this study that includes clinical and toxicological 
      aspects together with functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and 
      measurements of psychomotor skills. The fMRI paradigm was based on a visuo-motor 
      tracking task, alternating active tracking blocks with passive tracking viewing and 
      rest condition. We show that cannabis smoking, even at low Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol 
      blood concentrations, decreases psychomotor skills and alters the activity of the 
      brain networks involved in cognition. The relative decrease of Blood Oxygen Level 
      Dependent response (BOLD) after cannabis smoking in the anterior insula, dorsomedial 
      thalamus, and striatum compared to placebo smoking suggests an alteration of the 
      network involved in saliency detection. In addition, the decrease of BOLD response 
      in the right superior parietal cortex and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      indicates the involvement of the Control Executive network known to operate once the 
      saliencies are identified. Furthermore, cannabis increases activity in the rostral 
      anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, suggesting an 
      increase in self-oriented mental activity. Subjects are more attracted by 
      intrapersonal stimuli ("self") and fail to attend to task performance, leading to an 
      insufficient allocation of task-oriented resources and to sub-optimal performance. 
      These effects correlate with the subjective feeling of confusion rather than with 
      the blood level of Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol. These findings bolster the 
      zero-tolerance policy adopted in several countries that prohibits the presence of 
      any amount of drugs in blood while driving.

TI  - An investigation of the relationship between glutamate and resting state 
      connectivity in chronic cannabis users.
PG  - 2062-2071

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that heavy cannabis (CB) use interacts with 
      glutamatergic signaling. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that glutamate 
      (Glu) may drive resting state functional connectivity (RSfc). The aims of the 
      current preliminary study were to: 1) determine whether dorsal anterior cingulate 
      cortex (dACC) Glu is related to RSfc between the dACC and two nodes of the reward 
      network, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and hippocampus (Hp); and 2) determine whether 
      CB use interacts with the relationship between dACC Glu and RSfc. A group of 23 
      chronic CB users and 23 healthy controls participated in this multimodal MRI study. 
      Glu levels were assessed in the dACC using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 
      Linear regression models were used to determine whether dACC Glu and CB use predicts 
      RSfc between the dACC and the NAc and Hp. While the effect size is small, the 
      results showed that the connectivity between the dACC and right NAc was predicted by 
      the interaction between dACC Glu levels and monthly CB use. Additionally, while 
      there is some suggestion that dACC Glu is correlated with dACC-hippocampal 
      connectivity, unlike for dACC/NAc connectivity the relationship between them does 
      not appear to be affected by CB use. These preliminary findings are significant in 
      that they demonstrate the need for future studies with larger sample sizes to better 
      characterize the relationship between resting state connectivity and neurochemistry 
      as well as to characterize how CB use interacts with that relationship.

TI  - Shifted balance of dorsal versus ventral striatal communication with frontal reward 
      and regulatory regions in cannabis-dependent males.
PG  - 5062-5073
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24345 [doi]
AB  - The transition from voluntary to addictive behavior is characterized by a loss of 
      regulatory control in favor of reward driven behavior. Animal models indicate that 
      this process is neurally underpinned by a shift in ventral-dorsal striatal control 
      of behavior; however, this shift has not been directly examined in humans. The 
      present resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study employed a 
      two-step approach to: (a) precisely map striatal alterations using a novel, 
      data-driven network classification strategy combining intrinsic connectivity 
      contrast with multivoxel pattern analysis and, (b) to determine whether a ventral to 
      dorsal striatal shift in connectivity with reward and regulatory control regions can 
      be observed in abstinent (28 days) male cannabis-dependent individuals (n = 24) 
      relative to matched controls (n = 28). Network classification revealed that the 
      groups can be reliably discriminated by global connectivity profiles of two striatal 
      regions that mapped onto the ventral (nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum 
      (caudate). Subsequent functional connectivity analysis demonstrated a relative shift 
      between ventral and dorsal striatal communication with fronto-limbic regions that 
      have been consistently involved in reward processing (rostral anterior cingulate 
      cortex [ACC]) and executive/regulatory functions (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex 
      [PFC]). Specifically, in the cannabis-dependent subjects, connectivity between the 
      ventral striatum with the rostral ACC increased, whereas both striatal regions were 
      uncoupled from the regulatory dorsomedial PFC. Together, these findings suggest a 
      shift in the balance between dorsal and ventral striatal control in cannabis 
      dependence. Similar changes have been observed in animal models and may promote the 
      loss of control central to addictive behavior.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy program for cannabis use cessation in first-episode 
      psychosis patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The high rate of cannabis use among patients with first-episode 
      psychosis (FEP), as well as the associated negative impact on illness course and 
      treatment outcomes, underlines the need for effective interventions in these 
      populations. However, to date, there have been few clinical treatment trials (of 
      pharmacological or psychological interventions) that have specifically focused on 
      addressing comorbid cannabis use among these patients. The aim of this paper is to 
      describe the design of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial in which 
      the objective is to assess the efficacy of a specific cognitive behavioral therapy 
      program for cannabis cessation in patients with FEP compared to standard treatment 
      (psychoeducation). METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-blind randomized study with 1 
      year of follow-up. Patients are to be randomly assigned to one of two treatments: 
      (1) specific cognitive behavioral therapy for cannabis cessation composed of 1-hour 
      sessions once a week for 16 weeks, in addition to pharmacological treatment 
      scheduled by the psychiatrist, or (2) a control group 
      (psychoeducation + pharmacological treatment) following the same format as the 
      experimental group. Participants in both groups will be evaluated at baseline 
      (pre-treatment), at 16 weeks (post-treatment), and at 3 and 6 months and 1 year of 
      follow-up. The primary outcome will be that patients in the experimental group will 
      have greater cannabis cessation than patients in the control group at 
      post-treatment. The secondary outcome will be that the experimental group will have 
      better clinical and functional outcomes than the control group. DISCUSSION: This 
      study provides the description of a clinical trial design based on specific 
      cognitive behavioral therapy for cannabis cessation in FEP patients, aiming to 
      improve clinical and functional outcome, as well as tackling the addictive disorder.

TI  - Sex Without Contraceptives in a Multicenter Study of Adolescent Emergency Department 
      Patients.
PG  - 283-290
LID - 10.1111/acem.13867 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the United States, rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually 
      transmitted infections (STIs) remain exceptionally high, and racial and ethnic 
      disparities persist. Emergency departments (EDs) care for over 19 million 
      adolescents each year, the majority being minority and low socioeconomic status. 
      Single-center studies demonstrate infrequent use of contraceptives among adolescent 
      ED patients and an association between risky sex and behaviors such as alcohol and 
      drug use; however, no multicenter ED data exist. The objectives of this study were 
      to 1) determine the prevalence of sex without contraceptives in a large multicenter 
      adolescent ED study and 2) assess patient demographic and risky behaviors associated 
      with sex without contraceptives. METHODS: Participants aged 14 to 17 years 
      (n = 3,247) in 16 pediatric EDs across the United States completed an electronic 
      survey. Questions focused on validated measures of risky sex; use of alcohol, 
      tobacco, marijuana, and other drugs; and depression and violence. In this secondary 
      analysis, we constructed univariable and multivariable models to identify 
      demographic and behavioral factors associated with sex without contraceptives (our 
      primary outcome), separately for adolescent males and females. RESULTS: In the prior 
      year, 17.4% (236/1,356) of males and 15.8% (299/1,891) of females had sex without 
      contraceptives. In the multivariable model, sex without contraceptives for both 
      genders was more likely among teens who were black, with conduct problems and 
      participated in casual sex, binge drinking, or cannabis use. Sex without 
      contraceptives was also more likely among Hispanic and cigarette-smoking males, as 
      well as depressed females. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent ED patients across the United 
      States are participating in risky sexual behaviors that increase their likelihood of 
      pregnancy and STI acquisition. These adolescents report a number of problem 
      behaviors, including substance use, which are strongly correlated with unprotected 
      sex. The ED visit may be an opportunity to identify at-risk adolescent patients, 
      address risky behaviors, and intervene to improve adolescent health.

TI  - Increased risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated patients with 
      substance use disorders in the United States between December 2020 and August 2021.
PG  - 124-132

AB  - Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) are at increased risk for COVID-19 
      infection and for adverse outcomes of the infection. Though vaccines are highly 
      effective against COVID-19, their effectiveness in individuals with SUDs might be 
      curtailed by compromised immune status and a greater likelihood of exposures, added 
      to the waning vaccine immunity and the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. In a 
      population-based cohort study, we assessed the risk, time trends, outcomes and 
      disparities of COVID-19 breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated SUD patients 
      starting 14 days after completion of vaccination. The study included 579,372 
      individuals (30,183 with a diagnosis of SUD and 549,189 without such a diagnosis) 
      who were fully vaccinated between December 2020 and August 2021, and had not 
      contracted COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination. We used the TriNetX Analytics 
      network platform to access de-identified electronic health records from 63 health 
      care organizations in the US. Among SUD patients, the risk for breakthrough 
      infection ranged from 6.8% for tobacco use disorder to 7.8% for cannabis use 
      disorder, all significantly higher than the 3.6% in non-SUD population (p<0.001). 
      Breakthrough infection risk remained significantly higher after controlling for 
      demographics (age, gender, ethnicity) and vaccine types for all SUD subtypes, except 
      for tobacco use disorder, and was highest for cocaine and cannabis use disorders 
      (hazard ratio, HR=2.06, 95% CI: 1.30-3.25 for cocaine; HR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.39-2.66 
      for cannabis). When we matched SUD and non-SUD individuals for lifetime 
      comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic determinants of health, the risk for 
      breakthrough infection no longer differed between these populations, except for 
      patients with cannabis use disorder, who remained at increased risk (HR=1.55, 95% 
      CI: 1.22-1.99). The risk for breakthrough infection was higher in SUD patients who 
      received the Pfizer than the Moderna vaccine (HR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.31-1.69). In the 
      vaccinated SUD population, the risk for hospitalization was 22.5% for the 
      breakthrough cohort and 1.6% for the non-breakthrough cohort (risk ratio, RR=14.4, 
      95% CI: 10.19-20.42), while the risk for death was 1.7% and 0.5% respectively 
      (RR=3.5, 95% CI: 1.74-7.05). No significant age, gender and ethnic disparities for 
      breakthrough infection were observed in vaccinated SUD patients. These data suggest 
      that fully vaccinated SUD individuals are at higher risk for breakthrough COVID-19 
      infection, and this is largely due to their higher prevalence of comorbidities and 
      adverse socioeconomic determinants of health compared with non-SUD individuals. The 
      high frequency of comorbidities in SUD patients is also likely to contribute to 
      their high rates of hospitalization and death following breakthrough infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabinoids including cannabidiol have recognized genotoxic activities 
      but their significance has not been studied broadly epidemiologically across the 
      teratological spectrum. We examined these issues including contextual space-time 
      relationships and formal causal inferential analysis in USA. METHODS: State 
      congenital anomaly (CA) rate (CAR) data was taken from the annual reports of the 
      National Birth Defects Prevention Network 2001-2005 to 2011-2015. Substance abuse 
      rates were from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health a nationally 
      representative longitudinal survey of the non-institutionalized US population with 
      74.1% response rate. Drugs examined were cigarettes, monthly and binge alcohol, 
      monthly cannabis and analgesic and cocaine abuse. Early termination of pregnancy for 
      abortion (ETOPFA) rates were taken from the published literature. Cannabinoid 
      concentrations were from Drug Enforcement Agency. Ethnicity and income data were 
      from the US Census Bureau. Inverse probability weighted (IPW) regressions and 
      geotemporospatial regressions conducted for selected CAs. RESULTS: Data on 
      18,328,529 births from an aggregated population of 2,377,483,589 for mid-year 
      analyses 2005-2013 comprehending 12,611 CARs for 62 CAs was assembled and 
      ETOPFA-corrected (ETOPFACAR) where appropriate. E-Values for ETOPFACARs by substance 
      trends were elevated for THC (40 CAs), cannabis (35 CAs), tobacco (11 CAs), 
      cannabidiol (8 CAs), monthly alcohol (5 CAs) and binge alcohol (2 CAs) with minimum 
      E-Values descending from 16.55, 1.55x10(7), 555.10, 7.53x10(19), 9.30 and 32.98. 
      Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, chromosomal, limb reductions, urinary, face and 
      body wall CAs particularly affected. Highest v. lowest substance use quintile CAR 
      prevalence ratios 2.84 (95%C.I. 2.44, 3.31), 4.85 (4.08, 5.77) and 1.92 (1.63, 2.27) 
      and attributable fraction in exposed 0.28 (0.27, 0.28), 0.57 (0.51, 0.62) and 0.47 
      (0.38, 0.55) for tobacco, cannabis and cannabidiol. Small intestinal stenosis or 
      atresia and obstructive genitourinary defect were studied in detail in lagged IPW 
      pseudo-randomized causal regressions and spatiotemporal models confirmed the causal 
      role of cannabinoids. Spatiotemporal predictive modelling demonstrated strongly 
      sigmoidal non-linear cannabidiol dose-response power-function relationships 
      (P = 2.83x10(-60) and 1.61x10(-71) respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Data implicate 
      cannabinoids including cannabidiol in a diverse spectrum of heritable CAs. Sigmoidal 
      non-linear dose-response relationships are of grave concern. These transgenerational 
      genotoxic, epigenotoxic, chromosomal-toxic putatively causal teratogenic effects 
      strongly indicate tight restrictions on community cannabinoid penetration.

TI  - Epigenetic Mediation of AKT1 rs1130233's Effect on 
      Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol-Induced Medial Temporal Function during Fear 
      Processing.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11091240 [doi]
LID - 1240
AB  - High doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of 
      cannabis, have been shown to have anxiogenic effects. Additionally, THC effects have 
      been shown to be modulated by genotype, including the single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) rs1130233 at the protein kinase AKT1 gene, a key component of the dopamine 
      signalling cascade. As such, it is likely that epigenetic methylation around this 
      SNP may affect AKT gene expression, which may in turn impact on the acute effects of 
      THC on brain function. We investigated the genetic (AKT1 rs1130233) and epigenetic 
      modulation of brain function during fear processing in a 2-session, double-blind, 
      cross-over, randomized placebo-controlled THC administration, in 36 healthy males. 
      Fear processing was assessed using an emotion (fear processing) paradigm, under 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Complete genetic and fMRI data were 
      available for 34 participants. THC caused an increase in anxiety and transient 
      psychotomimetic symptoms and para-hippocampal gyrus/amygdala activation. Number of A 
      alleles at the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP, and percentage methylation at the CpG(11-12) 
      site, were independently associated with a greater effect of THC on activation in a 
      network of brain regions including left and right parahippocampal gyri, 
      respectively. AKT1 rs1130233 moderation of the THC effect on left parahippocampal 
      activation persisted after covarying for methylation percentage, and was partially 
      mediated in sections of the left parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus by methylation 
      percentage. These results may offer an example of how genetic and epigenetic 
      variations influence the psychotomimetic and neurofunctional effects of THC.

AB  - Men consume the most nicotine and cannabis products but impacts on sperm epigenetics 
      are poorly characterized. Evidence suggests that preconception exposure to these 
      drugs alters offspring neurodevelopment. Epigenetics may in part facilitate 
      heritability. We therefore compared effects of exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol 
      (THC) and nicotine on DNA methylation in rat sperm at genes involved in 
      neurodevelopment. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data from sperm of 
      rats exposed to THC via oral gavage showed that seven neurodevelopmentally active 
      genes were significantly differentially methylated versus controls. Pyrosequencing 
      data revealed majority overlap in differential methylation in sperm from rats 
      exposed to THC via injection as well as those exposed to nicotine. 
      Neurodevelopmental genes including autism candidates are vulnerable to environmental 
      exposures and common features may mediate this vulnerability. We discovered that 
      autism candidate genes are significantly enriched for bivalent chromatin structure, 
      suggesting this configuration may increase vulnerability of genes in sperm to 
      disrupted methylation.

TI  - Individual and poly-substance use and condomless sex among HIV-uninfected adults 
      reporting heterosexual sex in a multi-site cohort.
PG  - 2002
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-12026-7 [doi]
LID - 2002
AB  - BACKGROUND: We analyzed the association between substance use (SU) and condomless 
      sex (CS) among HIV-negative adults reporting heterosexual sex in the Seek, Test, 
      Treat, and Retain (STTR) consortium. We describe the impact of SU as well as 
      person/partner and context-related factors on CS, identifying combinations of 
      factors that indicate the highest likelihood of CS. METHODS: We analyzed data from 
      four US-based STTR studies to examine the effect of SU on CS using two SU exposures: 
      1) recent SU (within 3 months) and 2) SU before/during sex. Behavioral data were 
      collected via 1:1 or self-administered computerized interviews. Adjusted 
      individual-study, multivariable relative risk regression was used to examine the 
      relationship between CS and SU. We also examined interactions with type of sex and 
      partner HIV status. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using traditional 
      fixed-effects meta-analysis. We analyzed data for recent SU (n = 6781; 82% men, 
      median age = 33 years) and SU before/during sex (n = 2915; 69% men, median 
      age = 40 years). RESULTS: For both exposure classifications, any SU other than 
      cannabis increased the likelihood of CS relative to non-SU (8-16%, p-values< 0.001). 
      In the recent SU group, however, polysubstance use did not increase the likelihood 
      of CS compared to single-substance use. Cannabis use did not increase the likelihood 
      of CS, regardless of frequency of use. Type of sex was associated with CS; those 
      reporting vaginal and anal sex had a higher likelihood of CS compared to vaginal sex 
      only for both exposure classifications (18-21%, p < 0.001). Recent SU increased 
      likelihood of CS among those reporting vaginal sex only (9-10%, p < 0.001); results 
      were similar for those reporting vaginal and anal sex (5-8%, p < 0.01). SU 
      before/during sex increased the likelihood of CS among those reporting vaginal sex 
      only (20%; p < 0.001) and among those reporting vaginal and anal sex (7%; 
      p = 0.002). Single- and poly-SU before/during sex increased the likelihood of CS for 
      those with exclusively HIV-negative partners (7-8%, p ≤ 0.02), and for those 
      reporting HIV-negative and HIV-status unknown partners (9-13%, p ≤ 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Except for cannabis, any SU increased the likelihood of CS. CS was 
      associated with having perceived HIV-negative partners and with having had both 
      anal/vaginal sex.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a wealth of studies seeking to identify factors associated with 
      nonadherence few consistent predictors have been determined, and several gaps still 
      exist in the literature. METHOD: We assessed 110 consecutively admitted patients 
      diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to ICD-10 
      criteria. Assessments were performed during hospitalization and at six-months 
      follow-up. Evaluation included sociodemographic, clinical, psychopathologic and 
      treatment-related variables. Prevalence of nonadherence, associated variables, 
      reasons for nonadherence and possible subtypes were explored. Adherence was defined 
      as the concurrence of adherence to antipsychotic treatment and adherence to 
      outpatient follow-up, during the six-month period. RESULTS: Nonadherence was 
      detected in 58.2% of patients. An identifiable profile was found in nonadherent 
      patients. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, low socio-economic level 
      (OR = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.42-9.53), current cannabis use or abuse (OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 
      1.07-7.28), nonadherence as a reason for relapse and admission (OR = 5.46; 95% CI = 
      2.00-14.90), and greater overall severity of symptoms at six months follow-up (OR = 
      2.00; 95% CI = 1.02-3.95) remained independently associated with nonadherence. 
      Believing that medication is unnecessary was the most reported reason for 
      nonadherence. For nonadherent patients (N = 64), two distinguishable subtypes were 
      found: intentional nonadherence (N = 32; 50%), and unintentional nonadherence (N = 
      32; 50%). CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of patients with schizophrenia or 
      schizoaffective disorder did not adhere to their treatment in the post-discharge 
      follow-up period. The profile identified may enable better prevention of this 
      problem. Specific reasons for nonadherence should also be explored to provide 
      individualized strategies.

TI  - Prenatal tobacco and marijuana co-use: Sex-specific influences on infant cortisol 
      stress response.

AB  - Although tobacco (TOB) and marijuana (MJ) are often co-used in pregnancy, little is 
      known regarding the joint impact of MJ + TOB on offspring development, including the 
      developing neuroendocrine stress system. Further, despite evidence for sex-specific 
      impacts of prenatal exposures in preclinical models, the sex-specific impact of 
      prenatal MJ + TOB exposure on offspring neuroendocrine regulation in humans is also 
      unknown. In the current study, overall and sex-specific influences of MJ + TOB 
      co-use on offspring cortisol regulation were investigated over the first postnatal 
      month. 111 mother-infant pairs from a low-income, racially and ethnically diverse 
      sample participated. Based on Timeline Followback data with biochemical 
      verification, three groups were identified: (1) prenatal MJ + TOB, (2) TOB only, and 
      (3) controls. Baseline cortisol and cortisol stress response were assessed at seven 
      points over the first postnatal month using a handling paradigm in which saliva 
      cortisol was assessed before, during, and following a standard neurobehavioral 
      assessment (NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale). A significant exposure group by 
      offspring sex interaction emerged for baseline cortisol over the first postnatal 
      month (p = .043); MJ + TOB-exposed males showed 35-36% attenuation of baseline 
      cortisol levels vs. unexposed and TOB-exposed males (ps ≤ .003), while no effects of 
      exposure emerged for females. Both MJ + TOB and TOB-exposed infants showed a 22% 
      attenuation of cortisol stress response over the first postnatal month vs. unexposed 
      infants (ps < .03), with evidence for sex-specific effects in exploratory analyses. 
      Although results are preliminary, this is the first human study to investigate the 
      impact of prenatal MJ exposure on infant cortisol and the first to reveal a 
      sex-specific impact of prenatal MJ + TOB on cortisol regulation in humans. Future, 
      larger-scale studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms and consequences of 
      sex-specific effects of MJ and MJ + TOB on the developing neuroendocrine stress 
      system.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationships between sexual behavior and risk factors to 
      physical and mental health in adolescents. METHODS: Study of 3,195 pupils aged 15 to 
      19 in secondary education, in public and private schools in 10 state capitals in 
      Brazil between 2007 and 2008. Multi-stage (schools and pupils) cluster sampling was 
      used in each city and public and private educational network. All of the students 
      selected completed a questionnaire on the following items: socioeconomic and 
      demographic data; sexual behavior; having sex with those of the same sex, the 
      opposite sex, or both; alcohol and cannabis use; using condoms; traumatic sexual 
      experiences as a child or adolescent; suicidal thoughts. The analysis included 
      describing frequencies, Chi-square test, analysis of multiple and cluster 
      correspondence. Responses to an open ended question in which the adolescent 
      expressed general comments about themselves and their lives were qualitatively 
      analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Around 3.0% of adolescents reported 
      homosexual or bisexual behavior, with no difference according to sex, age, skin 
      color, social status family structure or educational network. Adolescents with 
      homosexual/bisexual sexual behavior, compared to their heterosexual peers, reported: 
      (p < 0.05): getting drunk (18.7% and 10.5%, respectively), frequent cannabis use 
      (6.1% and 2.1%, respectively), suicidal thoughts (42.5% and 18.7%, respectively), 
      and having been the victim of sexual violence (11.7% and 1.5%; respectively). 
      Adolescents with homosexual/bisexual sexual behavior reported that they used condoms 
      less frequently (74.2%) than their heterosexual peers (48.6%, p < 0.001). In the 
      correspondence analysis, three groups were found, one composed of adolescents with 
      homosexual/bisexual behavior and experiencing risk factors; suffering sexual 
      violence, never using a condom, suicidal thoughts, frequent cannabis use; another 
      composed of occasional cannabis and condom users, who got drunk frequently, and 
      adolescents with heterosexual behavior and none of the risk factors investigated. 
      More of the risk factors were found in adolescents with homosexual/bisexual behavior 
      compared with those with heterosexual behavior. Adolescents with homosexual/bisexual 
      sexual behavior were more likely to talk about their positive personal experiences 
      and negative relationship experiences that their heterosexual peers, but spoke less 
      about religion. CONCLUSIONS: Not only should this issue be studied in more detail, 
      but preventative actions aimed at adolescents with homosexual/bisexual behavior 
      should be widened.

TI  - The electrophysiological effects of cannabidiol on action potentials and 
      transmembrane potassium currents in rabbit and dog cardiac ventricular preparations.

AB  - Cannabis use is associated with known cardiovascular side effects such as cardiac 
      arrhythmias or even sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms behind these adverse 
      effects are unknown. The aim of the present work was to study the cellular cardiac 
      electrophysiological effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on action potentials and several 
      transmembrane potassium currents, such as the rapid (I(Kr)) and slow (I(Ks)) delayed 
      rectifier, the transient outward (I(to)) and inward rectifier (I(K1)) potassium 
      currents in rabbit and dog cardiac preparations. CBD increased action potential 
      duration (APD) significantly in both rabbit (from 211.7 ± 11.2. to 224.6 ± 11.4 ms, 
      n = 8) and dog (from 215.2 ± 9.0 to 231.7 ± 4.7 ms, n = 6) ventricular papillary 
      muscle at 5 µM concentration. CBD decreased I(Kr), I(Ks) and I(to) (only in dog) 
      significantly with corresponding estimated EC(50) values of 4.9, 3.1 and 5 µM, 
      respectively, without changing I(K1). Although the EC(50) value of CBD was found to 
      be higher than literary C(max) values after CBD smoking and oral intake, our results 
      raise the possibility that potassium channel inhibition by lengthening cardiac 
      repolarization might have a role in the possible proarrhythmic side effects of 
      cannabinoids in situations where CBD metabolism and/or the repolarization reserve is 
      impaired.

AB  - Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive compound in Cannabis, 
      which is studied extensively for its medicinal value. A central gap in the science 
      is the underlying mechanisms surrounding THC's therapeutic effects and the role of 
      gut metabolite profiles. Using a mass-spectrometry based metabolomics, we show here 
      that intraperitoneal injection of THC in C57BL/6 mice modulates metabolic profiles 
      that have previously been identified as integral to health. Specifically, we 
      investigated the effects of acute (single THC injection denoted here as '1X') and 
      short -term (five THC injections on alternate days denoted as '5X') THC 
      administration on fecal and intestinal tissue metabolite profiles. Results are 
      consistent with the hypothesis that THC administration alters host metabolism by 
      targeting two prominent lipid metabolism pathways: glycerophospholipid metabolism 
      and fatty acid biosynthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a prevalent and impairing condition, and 
      established psychosocial treatments convey limited efficacy. In light of recent 
      findings supporting the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for CUD in adolescents, 
      the objective of this trial was to evaluate its efficacy in adults. METHODS: In a 
      12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, treatment-seeking adults 
      ages 18-50 with CUD (N=302), enrolled across six National Drug Abuse Treatment 
      Clinical Trials Network-affiliated clinical sites, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
      a 12-week course of NAC 1200mg (n=153) or placebo (n=149) twice daily. All 
      participants received contingency management (CM) and medical management. The 
      primary efficacy measure was the odds of negative urine cannabinoid tests during 
      treatment, compared between NAC and placebo participants. RESULTS: There was not 
      statistically significant evidence that the NAC and placebo groups differed in 
      cannabis abstinence (odds ratio=1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.63-1.59, p=0.984). 
      Overall, 22.3% of urine cannabinoid tests in the NAC group were negative, compared 
      with 22.4% in the placebo group. Many participants were medication non-adherent; 
      exploratory analysis within medication-adherent subgroups revealed no significant 
      differential abstinence outcomes by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with 
      prior findings in adolescents, there is no evidence that NAC 1200mg twice daily plus 
      CM is differentially efficacious for CUD in adults when compared to placebo plus CM. 
      This discrepant finding between adolescents and adults with CUD may have been 
      influenced by differences in development, cannabis use profiles, responses to 
      embedded behavioral treatment, medication adherence, and other factors.

LID - 10.1007/s00127-020-01831-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The EUropean Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying 
      Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) study contains an unparalleled wealth of 
      comprehensive data that allows for testing hypotheses about (1) variations in 
      incidence within and between countries, including by urbanicity and minority ethnic 
      groups; and (2) the role of multiple environmental and genetic risk factors, and 
      their interactions, in the development of psychotic disorders. METHODS: Between 2010 
      and 2015, we identified 2774 incident cases of psychotic disorders during 12.9 
      million person-years at risk, across 17 sites in 6 countries (UK, The Netherlands, 
      France, Spain, Italy, and Brazil). Of the 2774 incident cases, 1130 cases were 
      assessed in detail and form the case sample for case-control analyses. Across all 
      sites, 1497 controls were recruited and assessed. We collected data on an extensive 
      range of exposures and outcomes, including demographic, clinical (e.g. premorbid 
      adjustment), social (e.g. childhood and adult adversity, cannabis use, migration, 
      discrimination), cognitive (e.g. IQ, facial affect processing, attributional 
      biases), and biological (DNA via blood sample/cheek swab). We describe the 
      methodology of the study and some descriptive results, including representativeness 
      of the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This resource constitutes the largest and most extensive 
      incidence and case-control study of psychosis ever conducted.

TI  - Effectiveness of attentional bias modification training as add-on to regular 
      treatment in alcohol and cannabis use disorder: A multicenter randomized control 
      trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Attentional bias for substance-relevant cues has been found to 
      contribute to the persistence of addiction. Attentional bias modification (ABM) 
      interventions might, therefore, increase positive treatment outcome and reduce 
      relapse rates. The current study investigated the effectiveness of a newly developed 
      home-delivered, multi-session, internet-based ABM intervention, the Bouncing Image 
      Training Task (BITT), as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: 
      Participants (N = 169), diagnosed with alcohol or cannabis use disorder, were 
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the experimental ABM group (50%; 
      TAU+ABM); or the control group (50%; split in two subgroups the TAU+placebo group 
      and TAU-only group, 25% each). Participants completed baseline, post-test, and 6 and 
      12 months follow-up measures of substance use and craving allowing to assess 
      long-term treatment success and relapse rates. In addition, attentional bias (both 
      engagement and disengagement), as well as secondary physical and psychological 
      complaints (depression, anxiety, and stress) were assessed. RESULTS: No significant 
      differences were found between conditions with regard to substance use, craving, 
      relapse rates, attentional bias, or physical and psychological complaints. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings may reflect unsuccessful modification of attentional bias, 
      the BITT not targeting the relevant process (engagement vs. disengagement bias), or 
      may relate to the diverse treatment goals of the current sample (i.e., moderation or 
      abstinence). The current findings provide no support for the efficacy of this ABM 
      approach as an add-on to TAU in alcohol or cannabis use disorder. Future studies 
      need to delineate the role of engagement and disengagement bias in the persistence 
      of addiction, and the role of treatment goal in the effectiveness of ABM 
      interventions.

TI  - Risk Behaviours Associated with Dating and Relationship Violence among 11-16 Year 
      Olds in Wales: Results from the 2019 Student Health and Wellbeing Survey.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18031192 [doi]
LID - 1192
AB  - (1) Background: This study examines the associations between risk behaviours and 
      adolescent emotional and physical dating and relationship violence (DRV) 
      victimisation and perpetration, and how these vary by gender. The risk behaviours 
      explored include bullying, cyberbullying, sexting, alcohol, and cannabis use; (2) 
      Methods: Cross-sectional self-report data from the School Health Research Network 
      (SHRN) 2019 Student Health Wellbeing (SHW) survey of 48,397 students aged 11-16 from 
      149 schools across Wales were analysed using single and multiple-behaviour logistic 
      regression models to explore the associations between each risk behaviour and 
      emotional and physical DRV victimisation and perpetration; (3) Results: Bivariate 
      analyses revealed a statistically significant association between DRV and all risk 
      behaviours. In multivariate analyses, students who reported bullying, cyberbullying, 
      sexting, and substance use, compared to those that had not, had significantly higher 
      odds of experiencing and perpetrating emotional and physical DRV; and (4) 
      Conclusions: Future studies on DRV should consider a mixed-methods approach to 
      explore the context in which DRV and risk behaviours interrelate. Results from this 
      study indicate the possibility that prevention and intervention programmes in school 
      settings that seek to develop healthy school environments and peer-to-peer 
      relationships, could inadvertently reduce the occurrence of future DRV and 
      associated risk behaviours.

TI  - Trajectories of initiation for the heroin-based drug whoonga - qualitative evidence 
      from South Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whoonga is a smoked heroin-based street drug that first emerged in South 
      Africa a decade ago. While previous scientific reports suggest that use is growing 
      and youth are particularly vulnerable, trajectories of initiation are not well 
      characterized. METHODS: In 2015, 30 men undergoing residential addiction treatment 
      for this smoked heroin drug in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa participated in 
      semi-structured interviews about their experiences using the drug. Interview data 
      were coded using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participant trajectories to 
      initiating smoked heroin were "vertical" in the context of marijuana use or 
      "horizontal" in the context of other hard drug use. Participants reporting vertical 
      trajectories began smoking heroin as youth at school or in other settings where 
      people were smoking marijuana. Several participants with horizontal trajectories 
      started smoking heroin to address symptoms of other drug or alcohol addiction. 
      Social influences on initiation emerged as an overarching theme. Members of 
      participants' social networks who were smoking or distributing heroin figured 
      prominently in initiation narratives. Surprisingly, references to injection drug use 
      were absent from initiation narratives. Participants reported people who smoke 
      heroin differ from those who inject heroin by race. CONCLUSION: Consistent with 
      theories implicating social and structural influences on substance use initiation, 
      people who started smoking heroin had social contacts who smoked heroin and 
      frequented places where substance use was common. Smoked heroin initiation for 
      several participants with horizontal trajectories may have been averted if they 
      accessed evidence-based treatments for stimulant or alcohol use disorders. With 
      increasing reports of heroin use across Africa, a coordinated approach to address 
      this growing epidemic is needed. However, because smoked heroin and injection heroin 
      use occur in distinct risk environments, interventions tailored to people who use 
      smoked heroin will be needed to prevent smoked heroin use, prevent transition to 
      injection use, and mitigate other social harms.

TI  - Opioid agonist treatment and patient outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in south 
      east Sydney, Australia.
LID - 10.1111/dar.13382 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In early 2020, many services modified their delivery of opioid 
      treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to limit viral spread and maintain 
      treatment continuity. We describe the changes to treatment and preliminary analysis 
      of the association with patients' substance use and well-being. METHODS: A pre-post 
      comparison of treatment conditions and patient self-reported outcomes using data 
      extracted from electronic medical records in the 5 months before (December 
      2019-April 2020) and after (May 2020-September 2020) changes were implemented in 
      three public treatment services in South Eastern Sydney Local Health District. 
      RESULTS: Data are available for 429/460 (93%) patients. Few (21, 5%) dropped out of 
      treatment. In the 'post' period there was significantly more use of depot 
      buprenorphine (12-24%), access to any take-away doses (TAD; 24-69%), access to ≥6 
      TAD per week (7-31%), pharmacy dosing (24-52%) and telehealth services. There were 
      significant reductions in average opioid and benzodiazepine use, increases in 
      cannabis use, with limited group changes in social conditions, or quality of life, 
      psychological and physical health. At an individual level, 22% of patients reported 
      increases in their use of either alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines or stimulants of 
      ≥4 days in the past 4 weeks. Regression analysis indicates increases in substance 
      use were associated with higher levels of supervised dosing. DISCUSSION AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that the modified model of care 
      continued to provide safe and effective treatment, during the pandemic. Notably, 
      there was no association between more TAD and significant increases in substance 
      use. Limitations are discussed and further evaluation is needed.

TI  - Spontaneous, anecdotal, retrospective, open-label study on the efficacy, safety and 
      tolerability of cannabis galenical preparation (Bedrocan).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our main aim was to investigate the short-term therapeutic effects, 
      safety/tolerability and potential side effects of the cannabis galenical preparation 
      (Bedrocan) in patients with a range of chronic conditions unresponsive to other 
      treatments. METHODS: In this retrospective, 'compassionate use', observational, 
      open-label study, 20 patients (age 18-80 years) who had appealed to our 'Second 
      Opinion Medical Consulting Network' (Modena, Italy), were instructed to take 
      sublingually the galenical oil twice a day for 3 months of treatment. The usual 
      starting dose was low (0.5 ml/day) and gradually titrated upward to the highest 
      recommended dose (1 ml/day). Tolerability and adverse effects were assessed at 
      baseline and monthly thereafter during the treatment period through direct contact 
      (email or telephone) or visit if required. Patients' quality of life was evaluated 
      at baseline and 3 months using the medical outcome short-form health survey 
      questionnaire (SF-36). KEY FINDINGS: From baseline to 6 months post-treatment, SF-36 
      scores showed: reductions in total pain (P < 0.03); improvements in the physical 
      component (P < 0.02); vitality (P < 0.03); social role functioning (P < 0.02); and 
      general health state (P < 0.02). No changes in role limitations (P = 0.02) due to 
      emotional state (e.g. panic, depression, mood alteration) were reported. Monthly 
      reports of psychoactive adverse effects showed significant insomnia reduction 
      (P < 0.03) and improvement in mood (P < 0.03) and concentration (P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a cannabis galenical preparation may be 
      therapeutically effective and safe for the symptomatic treatment of some chronic 
      diseases. Further studies on the efficacy of cannabis as well as cannabinoid system 
      involvement in the pathophysiology are warranted.

TI  - Cannabidiol Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Cell Apoptosis in Human Gastric Cancer 
      SGC-7901 Cells.

LID - 302
AB  - The main chemical component of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has been shown to have 
      antitumor properties. The present study examined the in vitro effects of CBD on 
      human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells. We found that CBD significantly inhibited the 
      proliferation and colony formation of SGC-7901 cells. Further investigation showed 
      that CBD significantly upregulated ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) and p53 
      protein expression and downregulated p21 protein expression in SGC-7901 cells, which 
      subsequently inhibited the levels of CDK2 and cyclin E, thereby resulting in cell 
      cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase. In addition, CBD significantly increased Bax 
      expression levels, decreased Bcl-2 expression levels and mitochondrial membrane 
      potential, and then upregulated the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved 
      caspase-9, thereby inducing apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. Finally, we found that 
      intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased after CBD treatment. These 
      results indicated that CBD could induce G0-G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis 
      by increasing ROS production, leading to the inhibition of SGC-7901 cell 
      proliferation, thereby suggesting that CBD may have therapeutic effects on gastric 
      cancer.

TI  - Default mode network connectivity as a function of familial and environmental risk 
      for psychotic disorder.
PG  - e0120030
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0120030 [doi]
LID - e0120030
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research suggests that altered interregional connectivity in specific 
      networks, such as the default mode network (DMN), is associated with cognitive and 
      psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. In addition, frontal and limbic connectivity 
      alterations have been associated with trauma, drug use and urban upbringing, though 
      these environmental exposures have never been examined in relation to DMN functional 
      connectivity in psychotic disorder. METHODS: Resting-state functional MRI scans were 
      obtained from 73 patients with psychotic disorder, 83 non-psychotic siblings of 
      patients with psychotic disorder and 72 healthy controls. Posterior cingulate cortex 
      (PCC) seed-based correlation analysis was used to estimate functional connectivity 
      within the DMN. DMN functional connectivity was examined in relation to group 
      (familial risk), group × environmental exposure (to cannabis, developmental trauma 
      and urbanicity) and symptomatology. RESULTS: There was a significant association 
      between group and PCC connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), the 
      precuneus (PCu) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Compared to controls, 
      patients and siblings had increased PCC connectivity with the IPL, PCu and MPFC. In 
      the IPL and PCu, the functional connectivity of siblings was intermediate to that of 
      controls and patients. No significant associations were found between DMN 
      connectivity and (subclinical) psychotic/cognitive symptoms. In addition, there were 
      no significant interactions between group and environmental exposures in the model 
      of PCC functional connectivity. DISCUSSION: Increased functional connectivity in 
      individuals with (increased risk for) psychotic disorder may reflect trait-related 
      network alterations. The within-network "connectivity at rest" intermediate 
      phenotype was not associated with (subclinical) psychotic or cognitive symptoms. The 
      association between familial risk and DMN connectivity was not conditional on 
      environmental exposure.

TI  - Examining the association between exposome score for schizophrenia and functioning 
      in schizophrenia, siblings, and healthy controls: Results from the EUGEI study.
PG  - e25

LID - e25
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cumulative environmental exposure score for schizophrenia (exposome 
      score for schizophrenia [ES-SCZ]) may provide potential utility for risk 
      stratification and outcome prediction. Here, we investigated whether ES-SCZ was 
      associated with functioning in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 
      unaffected siblings, and healthy controls. METHODS: This cross-sectional sample 
      consisted of 1,261 patients, 1,282 unaffected siblings, and 1,525 healthy controls. 
      The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale was used to assess functioning. 
      ES-SCZ was calculated based on our previously validated method. The association 
      between ES-SCZ and the GAF dimensions (symptom and disability) was analyzed by 
      applying regression models in each group (patients, siblings, and controls). 
      Additional models included polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-SCZ) as a 
      covariate. RESULTS: ES-SCZ was associated with the GAF dimensions in patients 
      (symptom: B = -1.53, p-value = 0.001; disability: B = -1.44, p-value = 0.001), 
      siblings (symptom: B = -3.07, p-value < 0.001; disability: B = -2.52, 
      p-value < 0.001), and healthy controls (symptom: B = -1.50, p-value < 0.001; 
      disability: B = -1.31, p-value < 0.001). The results remained the same after 
      adjusting for PRS-SCZ. The degree of associations of ES-SCZ with both symptom and 
      disability dimensions were higher in unaffected siblings than in patients and 
      controls. By analyzing an independent dataset (the Genetic Risk and Outcome of 
      Psychosis study), we replicated the results observed in the patient group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ES-SCZ shows promise for enhancing risk 
      prediction and stratification in research practice. From a clinical perspective, 
      ES-SCZ may aid in efforts of clinical characterization, operationalizing 
      transdiagnostic clinical staging models, and personalizing clinical management.

AB  - Numerous questions surround the nature of reward processing in the developing 
      adolescent brain, particularly in regard to polysubstance use. We therefore sought 
      to examine incentive-elicited brain activation in the context of three common 
      substances of abuse (cannabis, tobacco, and alcohol). Due to the role of the nucleus 
      accumbens (NAcc) in incentive processing, we compared activation in this region 
      during anticipation of reward and loss using a monetary incentive delay (MID) task. 
      Adolescents (ages 14-18; 66% male) were matched on age, gender, and frequency of use 
      of any common substances within six distinct groups: cannabis-only (n=14), 
      tobacco-only (n=34), alcohol-only (n=12), cannabis+tobacco (n=17), 
      cannabis+tobacco+alcohol (n=17), and non-using controls (n=38). All groups showed 
      comparable behavioral performance on the MID task. The tobacco-only group showed 
      decreased bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation during reward anticipation 
      as compared to the alcohol-only group, the control group, and both polysubstance 
      groups. Interestingly, no differences emerged between the cannabis-only group and 
      any of the other groups. Results from this study suggest that youth who tend toward 
      single-substance tobacco use may possess behavioral and/or neurobiological 
      characteristics that differentiate them from both their substance-using and 
      non-substance-using peers.

TI  - DRD2 methylation is associated with executive control network connectivity and 
      severity of alcohol problems among a sample of polysubstance users.
PG  - e12684
LID - 10.1111/adb.12684 [doi]
AB  - Chronic exposure to alcohol and other drugs of abuse has been associated with 
      deleterious consequences, including functional connectivity deficits within neural 
      networks associated with executive control. Altered functional connectivity within 
      the executive control network (ECN) might underlie the progressive inability to 
      control consumption of alcohol and other drugs as substance use disorders progress. 
      Genetic and epigenetic factors have been associated with substance use disorders 
      (SUDs). For example, dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) functioning has been associated with 
      alcohol use disorder (AUD) and related phenotypes, including correlates of executive 
      functioning. The present study aims to explore the relationship between a continuous 
      measure of alcohol-related problems, epigenetic markers (methylation) within the 
      DRD2 gene, and functional connectivity within the ECN among a sample of 
      polysubstance users. A community sample of 658 subjects, whose consumption of 
      alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis span across a spectrum of quantity and frequency of 
      use, were obtained across previous studies in polysubstance using populations. 
      Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging was analyzed to identify 
      intrinsic connectivity networks using a priori regions of interest. Methylation 
      measurement of functionally relevant sites within the DRD2 gene was achieved via 
      pyrosequencing. Regression-based models, including mediation and moderation models, 
      tested the association between DRD2 methylation, functional connectivity within 
      intrinsic neural networks (including the ECN), and severity of alcohol problems. 
      Results suggest that average DRD2 methylation was negatively associated with right 
      ECN (RECN) and left ECN (LECN) connectivity, but not associated with other networks 
      tested, and DRD2 methylation was significantly associated with alcohol problems 
      severity. Mediation models were not supported, although moderation models suggested 
      that connectivity between edges within the RECN moderated the relationship between 
      DRD2 methylation and AUD severity. Results support a theoretical model in which 
      epigenetic factors are associated with neurobiological correlates of alcohol 
      consumption among a sample of polysubstance users.

TI  - The effects of marijuana smoking on lung function in older people.
LID - 1900826 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have associated marijuana exposure with increased 
      respiratory symptoms and chronic bronchitis among long-term cannabis smokers. The 
      long-term effects of smoked marijuana on lung function remain unclear. METHODS: We 
      determined the association of marijuana smoking with the risk of spirometrically 
      defined chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (post-bronchodilator forced 
      expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity ratio <0.7) in 5291 
      population-based individuals and the rate of decline in FEV(1) in a subset of 1285 
      males and females, aged ≥40 years, who self-reported use (or non-use) of marijuana 
      and tobacco cigarettes and performed spirometry before and after inhaled 
      bronchodilator on multiple occasions. Analysis for the decline in FEV(1) was 
      performed using random mixed effects regression models adjusted for age, sex and 
      body mass index. Heavy tobacco smoking and marijunana smoking was defined as 
      >20 pack-years and >20 joint-years, respectively. RESULTS: ∼20% of participants had 
      been or were current marijuana smokers with most having smoked tobacco cigarettes in 
      addition (83%). Among heavy marijuana users, the risk of COPD was significantly 
      increased (adjusted OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.55-3.88). Compared to never-smokers of 
      marijuana and tobacco, heavy marijuana smokers and heavy tobacco smokers experienced 
      a faster decline in FEV(1) by 29.5 mL·year(-1) (p=0.0007) and 21.1 mL·year(-1) 
      (p<0.0001), respectively. Those who smoked both substances experienced a decline of 
      32.31 mL·year(-1) (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Heavy marijuana smoking increases the 
      risk of COPD and accelerates FEV(1) decline in concomitant tobacco smokers beyond 
      that observed with tobacco alone.

TI  - Associations between digital technology and substance use among U.S. adolescents: 
      Results from the 2018 Monitoring the Future survey.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social media and other digital technology use facilitate connection among 
      adolescents, but also may reinforce norms and substance-related content from peers 
      and advertisers. We use nationally representative data to examine the association 
      between digital technology and past 30-day use of alcohol, cannabis, and vaping. 
      METHODS: Data were drawn from the 2018 Monitoring the Future survey of US 
      adolescents (N = 44,482). Poisson regressions estimated the association between 
      hours/day of technology use and past 30-day use of alcohol, cannabis, and vaping 
      adjusting for grade, sociodemographics, and other past-year drug use. RESULTS: 
      Across grades, mean hours of social media/day was 3.06 (standard deviation = 2.90), 
      past 30-day alcohol, cannabis, flavor vaping, cannabis vaping, and nicotine vaping 
      were 15.7 %, 12.6 %, 10.6 %, 4.9 %, and 11.2 %, respectively. Digital technology use 
      that required interaction with others was associated with increased risk of past 
      30-day drinking, cannabis use, and vaping. For example, social media 3+ hours/day 
      was associated with past 30-day drinking (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.99, 95 % 
      CI: 1.65, 2.41). The magnitude of association was consistent across texting, phone 
      calls, and video chatting, which were all more strongly associated with substance 
      use than with activities that do not require interaction such as gaming and watching 
      videos. CONCLUSION: Digital technology that facilitates interaction among 
      adolescents, such as texting and social media, is associated with past substance 
      use. Magnitudes of association are consistent across substances, supporting the 
      hypothesis that networks of adolescents are social drivers of substance use, rather 
      than the technology itself.

TI  - Clinical, cognitive and neuroanatomical associations of serum NMDAR autoantibodies 
      in people at clinical high risk for psychosis.
PG  - 2590-2604
LID - 10.1038/s41380-020-00899-w [doi]
AB  - Serum neuronal autoantibodies, such as those to the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), are 
      detectable in a subgroup of patients with psychotic disorders. It is not known if 
      they are present before the onset of psychosis or whether they are associated with 
      particular clinical features or outcomes. In a case-control study, sera from 254 
      subjects at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis and 116 healthy volunteers were 
      tested for antibodies against multiple neuronal antigens implicated in CNS 
      autoimmune disorders, using fixed and live cell-based assays (CBAs). Within the CHR 
      group, the relationship between NMDAR antibodies and symptoms, cognitive function 
      and clinical outcomes over 24 month follow-up was examined. CHR subjects were not 
      more frequently seropositive for neuronal autoantibodies than controls (8.3% vs. 
      5.2%; OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 0.58-3.90). The NMDAR was the most common target antigen 
      and NMDAR IgGs were more sensitively detected with live versus fixed CBAs 
      (p < 0.001). Preliminary phenotypic analyses revealed that within the CHR sample, 
      the NMDAR antibody seropositive subjects had higher levels of current depression, 
      performed worse on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (p < 0.05), and had a 
      markedly lower IQ (p < 0.01). NMDAR IgGs were not more frequent in subjects who 
      later became psychotic than those who did not. NMDAR antibody serostatus and titre 
      was associated with poorer levels of functioning at follow-up (p < 0.05) and the 
      presence of a neuronal autoantibody was associated with larger amygdala volumes 
      (p < 0.05). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that NMDAR autoantibodies are 
      detectable in a subgroup of CHR subjects at equal rates to controls. In the CHR 
      group, they are associated with affective psychopathology, impairments in verbal 
      memory, and overall cognitive function: these findings are qualitatively and 
      individually similar to core features of autoimmune encephalitis and/or animal 
      models of NMDAR antibody-mediated CNS disease. Overall the current work supports 
      further evaluation of NMDAR autoantibodies as a possible prognostic biomarker and 
      aetiological factor in a subset of people already meeting CHR criteria.

TI  - Use of Secukinumab in a Cohort of Erythrodermic Psoriatic Patients: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8060770 [doi]
LID - 770
AB  - Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is a dermatological emergency and its treatment with 
      secukinumab is still controversial. Furthermore, no data exist regarding the 
      prognostic value of drug abuse in such a condition. We performed a multi-center, 
      international, retrospective study, enrolling a sample of EP patients (body surface 
      area > 90%) who were treated with secukinumab (300 mg) during the study period from 
      December 2015 to December 2018. Demographics and clinical data were collected. Drug 
      abuses were screened and, specifically, smoking status (packages/year), cannabis use 
      (application/week) and alcoholism-tested with the Alcohol Use Disorders 
      Identification Test (AUDIT)-were assessed. All patients were followed for up to 52 
      weeks. We enrolled 13 EP patients, nine males, and four females, with a median age 
      of 40 (28-52) years. Patients naïve to biologic therapy were 3/13. Regarding drug 
      use, seven patients had a medium-high risk of alcohol addiction, three used cannabis 
      weekly, and seven were smokers with a pack/year index of 295 (190-365). The response 
      rate to secukinumab was 10/13 patients with a median time to clearance of three 
      weeks (1.5-3). No recurrences were registered in the 52-week follow-up and a 
      Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score of 90 was achieved. The entire cohort of 
      non-responders (n = 3) consumed at least two drugs of abuse (alcohol, smoking or 
      cannabis). Non-responders were switched to ustekinumab and obtained a PASI 100 in 24 
      weeks. However, given our observed number of patients using various drugs in 
      combination with secukinumab in EP, further studies are needed to ascertain drug 
      abuse prevalence in a larger EP cohort. Secukinumab remains a valid, effective and 
      safe therapeutic option for EP.

TI  - Tobacco use among Norwegian adolescents: from cigarettes to snus.
PG  - 1154-62
LID - 10.1111/add.12509 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To: (i) investigate the development of smoking and snus use among Norwegian 
      adolescents, and (ii) describe the users in each group. DESIGN: Two population-based 
      surveys with identical procedures in 2002 (response rate 91.0%) and 2010 (response 
      rate 84.3%). SETTING: Norway. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6217 respondents, aged 16-17 
      years. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected on smoking and snus use, socio-demographic 
      factors, school adjustment, social network, sport activities, alcohol and cannabis 
      use and depression symptoms. FINDINGS: Prevalence of daily smoking fell from 23.6% 
      in 2002 to 6.8% in 2010 (P < 0.001), while the prevalence of daily snus use 
      increased from 4.3 to 11.9% (P < 0.001). Dual daily use of cigarettes and snus 
      remained at 1%. The relative proportion of non-daily smokers using snus increased 
      steeply. Both snus users and smokers reported more adverse socio-economic 
      backgrounds, less favourable school adjustment and higher levels of alcohol 
      intoxication and cannabis use than non-users of tobacco. However, snus users were 
      better adjusted to school and used cannabis less often than smokers. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Adolescent smoking prevalence has fallen dramatically in Norway, accompanied by a 
      smaller increase in snus use. Young snus users in Norway have many of the same risk 
      factors as smokers, but to a lesser degree.

      vomiting.
LID - 10.1136/bcr-2014-205287 [doi]
LID - bcr2014205287
AB  - Cannabis is one of the most commonly used recreational drugs worldwide. Psychoactive 
      properties of the principal compound, δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol include euphoria, a 
      sense of relaxation and increased appetite. Chronic cannabis use has been associated 
      with the development of a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt discontinuation. Withdrawal 
      symptoms typically begin within 24 h of abstinence and manifest as irritability, 
      nervousness, sleep disturbances and decreased appetite. There is growing evidence 
      that supports the use of plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids for the treatment 
      of cannabis withdrawal. In this case report, we present 20-year-old woman who 
      developed protracted nausea and vomiting secondary to cannabis withdrawal and was 
      successfully treated with nabilone. Nausea and vomiting is not listed in the 
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal 
      syndrome and is an uncommon symptom presentation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is a major public health concern in Ireland. Alcohol 
      use disorder (AUD) disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM). 
      However, little is known about the prevalence of AUD in this group in Ireland 
      specifically, and the characteristics of MSM who may struggle with this. METHODS: 
      The European MSM Internet Survey 2017 was an online, self-completed, anonymous 
      questionnaire among MSM in Ireland. Standardised questions were used to explore a 
      variety of topics. The validated CAGE-4 questionnaire was used to screen for 
      potential AUD, defined as a CAGE-4 score of ≥2 out of 4. Multivariable-adjusted 
      logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with potential 
      AUD. RESULTS: In total, 1793 MSM met inclusion criteria. 31 % screened positive for 
      AUD. We observed higher odds of possible AUD among MSM who were bisexual (vs. 
      gay/homosexual) (aOR 1.48 95 %CI 1.01-2.18), native to Ireland (vs. non-native) (aOR 
      1.49 95 %CI 1.12-1.96), unemployed (vs. employed) (aOR 1.80 95 %CI 1.02-3.16), had 
      used illicit drugs in the previous year (vs. none) (cannabis only, aOR 1.74 95 %CI 
      1.14-2.63) (other illicit drugs, aOR 2.28 95 %CI 1.67-3.09), reported 
      anxiety/depression (vs. none) (aOR 1.73 95 %CI 1.12-2.66), and MSM who experienced 
      homophobic abuse (vs. never) (aOR 1.55 95 %CI 1.09-2.22). Student MSM were less 
      likely to screen positive for AUD (vs. employed) (aOR 0.65 95 %CI 0.46-0.93). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AUD appears to be higher in the MSM population 
      compared to the general male population in Ireland. Targeted interventions may be 
      warranted to reduce the burden of AUD among MSM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Problematic Internet use (PIU) or Internet addiction has been recognized 
      to be a behavioral addiction characterized by excessive or poorly controlled 
      preoccupations, urges, or behaviors regarding computer use and Internet access that 
      leads to impairment or distress resembling substance abuse. AIM: To investigate the 
      prevalence and characteristics of Internet use and abuse in a group of drug addicts 
      from Southern Italy, by means of a specific questionnaire ["Questionario 
      sull'Utilizzo delle Nuove Tecnologie" (QUNT)]. METHODS: All subjects (183) were 
      heavy smokers, almost 50% of them used heroin and/or opioid compounds, 30% alcohol, 
      10% cannabis, 8% cocaine, and 5% were polydrug users. Almost 10% of the individuals 
      were also suffering from gambling disorder. RESULTS: The time spent online was more 
      than 4 hours a day in the total sample, with a slight prevalence in male subjects. 
      Cocaine and cannabis users spent more than 6 hours online, significantly more than 
      opioid and alcohol abusers. Distribution of the QUNT factors was not different in 
      both sexes. Cocaine users showed higher scores at the "loss of control", 
      "pornography addiction", and "addiction to social networks" factors, for the 
      stimulant effect of this substance. Moreover, 15 out of the total 17 cocaine users 
      were pathological gamblers. Positive and statistically significant relationships 
      were observed between some QUNT factors and body mass index. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings indicate that PIU is less severe in subjects taking sedative substances, 
      such as heroin/opioids and alcohol, than in subjects taking stimulants. 
      Alternatively, it may be used as a "stimulant" trigger in cocaine and cannabis 
      users. Flattening effect of abuse drugs was noted on possible sex-related 
      differences in QUNT items. We observed a sort of "protective" effect of a love 
      relationship and/or living together with a partner, as those engaged subjects showed 
      lower scores on different items than single subjects or those living alone. The 
      relationship between time spent online (and related sedentary lifestyle) and body 
      mass index would suggest that Internet use might be a contributing factor to 
      increasing weight gain and obesity amongst adolescents and young adults worldwide. 
      Our findings also highlighted the specific vulnerability of drug addicts who use 
      stimulants, rather than sedative compounds, to other kinds of behavioral addictions, 
      such as gambling disorder.

TI  - Adolescent exposure to Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol alters the transcriptional 
      trajectory and dendritic architecture of prefrontal pyramidal neurons.
PG  - 588-600

AB  - Neuronal circuits within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediate higher cognitive 
      functions and emotional regulation that are disrupted in psychiatric disorders. The 
      PFC undergoes significant maturation during adolescence, a period when cannabis use 
      in humans has been linked to subsequent vulnerability to psychiatric disorders such 
      as addiction and schizophrenia. Here, we investigated in a rat model the effects of 
      adolescent exposure to Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive component of 
      cannabis, on the morphological architecture and transcriptional profile of layer III 
      pyramidal neurons-using cell type- and layer-specific high-resolution microscopy, 
      laser capture microdissection and next-generation RNA-sequencing. The results 
      confirmed known normal expansions in basal dendritic arborization and dendritic 
      spine pruning during the transition from late adolescence to early adulthood that 
      were accompanied by differential expression of gene networks associated with 
      neurodevelopment in control animals. In contrast, THC exposure disrupted the normal 
      developmental process by inducing premature pruning of dendritic spines and 
      allostatic atrophy of dendritic arborization in early adulthood. Surprisingly, there 
      was minimal overlap of the developmental transcriptomes between THC- and 
      vehicle-exposed rats. THC altered functional gene networks related to cell 
      morphogenesis, dendritic development, and cytoskeleton organization. Marked 
      developmental network disturbances were evident for epigenetic regulators with 
      enhanced co-expression of chromatin- and dendrite-related genes in THC-treated 
      animals. Dysregulated PFC co-expression networks common to both the THC-treated 
      animals and patients with schizophrenia were enriched for cytoskeletal and neurite 
      development. Overall, adolescent THC exposure altered the morphological and 
      transcriptional trajectory of PFC pyramidal neurons, which could enhance 
      vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Alexithymia in Patients With Substance Use Disorders and Its Relationship With 
      Psychiatric Comorbidities and Health-Related Quality of Life.
PG  - 659063
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.659063 [doi]
LID - 659063
AB  - Background: Alexithymia frequently correlates with several psychiatric disorders, 
      including substance use disorder (SUD). However, most studies reporting the 
      associations between alexithymia and psychiatric disorders have been performed in 
      populations without SUD. This research, therefore, evaluates alexithymia in Spanish 
      patients with SUD and the relationship among alexithymia, psychiatric comorbidities, 
      psychological symptoms/traits, SUD variables, and health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL). Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 126 Spanish 
      outpatients with SUD (75.4% males; mean age 43.72 ± 14.61 years), correlating their 
      alexithymia levels (using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 [TAS-20]) to their 
      psychiatric comorbidities, psychological symptoms/traits, SUD variables, and HRQoL. 
      Results: Alexithymia was significantly higher in patients who had cannabis use 
      disorder. Higher alexithymia scores were also related to higher levels of 
      depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and lower HRQoL. After multivariate analysis, 
      trait anxiety, impulsivity, and the physical component summary of the HRQoL were 
      found to be independently related to alexithymia. Conclusions: SUD patients with 
      higher alexithymia levels have more frequently psychiatric comorbidities, present 
      specific psychological features, and have worse HRQoL. Hence, it is important to 
      evaluate these factors and offer more accurate psychotherapeutic approaches for this 
      patient population.

AB  - Prenatal drug exposure, particularly prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE), incurs great 
      public and scientific interest because of its associated neurodevelopmental 
      consequences. However, the neural underpinnings of PCE remain essentially uncharted, 
      and existing studies in school-aged children and adolescents are confounded greatly 
      by postnatal environmental factors. In this study, leveraging a large neonate sample 
      (N = 152) and non-invasive resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we 
      compared human infants with PCE comorbid with other drugs (such as nicotine, 
      alcohol, marijuana, and antidepressant) with infants with similar non-cocaine poly 
      drug exposure and drug-free controls. We aimed to characterize the neural correlates 
      of PCE based on functional connectivity measurements of the amygdala and insula at 
      the earliest stage of development. Our results revealed common drug exposure-related 
      connectivity disruptions within the amygdala-frontal, insula-frontal, and 
      insula-sensorimotor circuits. Moreover, a cocaine-specific effect was detected 
      within a subregion of the amygdala-frontal network. This pathway is thought to play 
      an important role in arousal regulation, which has been shown to be irregular in PCE 
      infants and adolescents. These novel results provide the earliest human-based 
      functional delineations of the neural-developmental consequences of prenatal drug 
      exposure and thus open a new window for the advancement of effective strategies 
      aimed at early risk identification and intervention.

TI  - Screening for Adolescent Alcohol Use in the Emergency Department: What Does It Tell 
      Us About Cannabis, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use?
PG  - 1007-1016
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2018.1558251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pediatric emergency department (PED) represents an opportune time 
      for alcohol and drug screening. The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and 
      Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommends a two-question alcohol screen for adolescents as a 
      predictor of alcohol and drug misuse. OBJECTIVE: A multi-site PED study was 
      conducted to determine the association between the NIAAA two-question alcohol screen 
      and adolescent cannabis use disorders (CUD), cigarette smoking, and lifetime use of 
      other drugs. METHODS: Participants included 12-17-year olds (n = 4834) treated in 
      one of 16 participating PEDs. An assessment battery, including the NIAAA 
      two-question screen and other measures of alcohol, tobacco and drug use, was 
      self-administered on a tablet computer. RESULTS: A diagnosis of CUD, lifetime 
      tobacco use or lifetime drug use was predicted by any self-reported alcohol use in 
      the past year, which indicates a classification of moderate risk for middle school 
      ages and low risk for high school ages on the NIAAA two-question screen. Drinking 
      was most strongly predictive of a CUD, somewhat weaker for lifetime tobacco use, and 
      weakest for lifetime drug use. This same pattern held for high school and middle 
      school students and was stronger for high school students over middle school 
      students for all three categories. This association was also found across gender, 
      ethnicity and race. The association was strongest for CUD for high school students, 
      sensitivity 81.7% (95% CI, 77.0, 86.5) and specificity 70.4% (95% CI, 68.6, 72.1). 
      Conclusions/Importance: A single question about past year alcohol use can provide 
      valuable information about other substance use, particularly marijuana.

TI  - MONITORING POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS AND REACTIONS VIA NETWORK ANALYSIS OF 
      INSTAGRAM USER TIMELINES.
PG  - 492-503
AB  - Much recent research aims to identify evidence for Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) and 
      Adverse Drug reactions (ADR) from the biomedical scientific literature. In addition 
      to this "Bibliome", the universe of social media provides a very promising source of 
      large-scale data that can help identify DDI and ADR in ways that have not been 
      hitherto possible. Given the large number of users, analysis of social media data 
      may be useful to identify under-reported, population-level pathology associated with 
      DDI, thus further contributing to improvements in population health. Moreover, 
      tapping into this data allows us to infer drug interactions with natural 
      products-including cannabis-which constitute an array of DDI very poorly explored by 
      biomedical research thus far. Our goal is to determine the potential of Instagram 
      for public health monitoring and surveillance for DDI, ADR, and behavioral pathology 
      at large. Most social media analysis focuses on Twitter and Facebook, but Instagram 
      is an increasingly important platform, especially among teens, with unrestricted 
      access of public posts, high availability of posts with geolocation coordinates, and 
      images to supplement textual analysis. Using drug, symptom, and natural product 
      dictionaries for identification of the various types of DDI and ADR evidence, we 
      have collected close to 7000 user timelines spanning from October 2010 to June 
      2015.We report on 1) the development of a monitoring tool to easily observe 
      user-level timelines associated with drug and symptom terms of interest, and 2) 
      population-level behavior via the analysis of co-occurrence networks computed from 
      user timelines at three different scales: monthly, weekly, and daily occurrences. 
      Analysis of these networks further reveals 3) drug and symptom direct and indirect 
      associations with greater support in user timelines, as well as 4) clusters of 
      symptoms and drugs revealed by the collective behavior of the observed population. 
      This demonstrates that Instagram contains much drug- and pathology specific data for 
      public health monitoring of DDI and ADR, and that complex network analysis provides 
      an important toolbox to extract health-related associations and their support from 
      large-scale social media data.

TI  - Cannabinoid exposure in rat adolescence reprograms the initial behavioral, 
      molecular, and epigenetic response to cocaine.
PG  - 9991-10002

AB  - The initial response to an addictive substance can facilitate repeated use: That is, 
      individuals experiencing more positive effects are more likely to use that drug 
      again. Increasing evidence suggests that psychoactive cannabinoid use in adolescence 
      enhances the behavioral effects of cocaine. However, despite the behavioral data, 
      there is no neurobiological evidence demonstrating that cannabinoids can also alter 
      the brain's initial molecular and epigenetic response to cocaine. Here, we utilized 
      a multiomics approach (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
      phosphoproteomics) to characterize how the rat brain responds to its first encounter 
      with cocaine, with or without preexposure to the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 
      (WIN). We find that in adolescent (but not in adult) rats, preexposure to WIN 
      results in cross-sensitization to cocaine, which correlates with histone 
      hyperacetylation and decreased levels of HDAC6 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In 
      the PFC, we also find that WIN preexposure blunts the typical mRNA response to 
      cocaine and instead results in alternative splicing and chromatin accessibility 
      events, involving genes such as Npas2 Moreover, preexposure to WIN enhances the 
      effects of cocaine on protein phosphorylation, including ERK/MAPK-targets like 
      gephyrin, and modulates the synaptic AMPAR/GluR composition both in the PFC and the 
      nucleus accumbens (NAcc). PFC-NAcc gene network topological analyses, following 
      cocaine exposure, reveal distinct top nodes in the WIN preexposed group, which 
      include PACAP/ADCYAP1. These preclinical data demonstrate that adolescent 
      cannabinoid exposure reprograms the initial behavioral, molecular, and epigenetic 
      response to cocaine.

TI  - A service-level action research intervention to improve identification and treatment 
      of cannabis and related mental health issues in young Indigenous Australians: a 
      study protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Regular cannabis use is associated with negative mental health impacts 
      including psychosis, depression and anxiety. Rates of cannabis use have increased in 
      Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in northern Australia within the 
      last two decades, presenting a significant increased risk to young people's mental 
      health in these regions. Improved screening, early detection and treatment for 
      cannabis-related mental health issues are urgently required. This paper describes a 
      service-level action research intervention and evaluation protocol for use in the 
      few services where it is possible to engage young Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
      Islander Australians. METHODS/DESIGN: The protocol is being developed in two 
      services where youth mental health is core business: a primary healthcare centre and 
      a youth service in the Cairns and hinterland region, far north Queensland. The 
      protocol calls first for baseline data to be collected using staff and client 
      surveys; network mapping; and analysis of screening, treatment and referral rates. 
      The protocol's intervention phase is driven by service needs identified from 
      baseline data. Intervention strategies focus on implementing/enhancing cannabis 
      screening instruments and processes in line with current best practice; enhancing 
      networks with external drug and mental health services; developing culturally 
      acceptable training and resources; developing activities aiming to reduce cannabis 
      use in young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients using the services. The 
      protocol requires implementation of the multilevel intervention within each service 
      for 1 year, with follow-up data then collected and compared to baseline. Process 
      evaluation identifies the more effective intervention strategies and documents the 
      challenges to be overcome for full implementation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics 
      approval was provided by The James Cook University, Human Research Ethics Committee. 
      Ethics Approval Number H5322. Peer-reviewed publications will also be used to 
      disseminate the finding. Results will also be discussed with stakeholder 
      organisations.

TI  - Co-occurrence of substance use disorders and other mental disorders in people 
      undergoing specific treatment for any of them in Spain.
PG  - 1692
LID - 10.20882/adicciones.1692 [doi]
AB  - The co-occurrence of substance use disorders (SUD) and other mental disorders (OMD) 
      is assumed to be high but is, in fact, unknown in Spain; and it is approached from 
      different healthcare networks. The objective of the present study was to know the 
      prevalence of this co-occurrence, both in specific addiction treatment networks and 
      in mental health networks, in Spain. An observational, multicenter cross study, with 
      a randomized sample, of patients under treatment for SUD or OMD in different 
      Autonomous Communities of Spain was carried out (N=1,783). A specific ad hoc online 
      questionnaire collecting sociodemographic variables, substance use and diagnoses of 
      SUD and OMD was completed.The data obtained in the survey show a significant 
      concurrence of SUD and OMD diagnoses (in more than 60% of the patients). A high 
      prevalence of OMD was found in those patients receiving treatment for their SUD 
      (71%), and also of diagnoses of any SUD (68.9%) and active substance use (50%, 
      except tobacco) in people receiving treatment for diagnoses of OMD. Also were found 
      significant relationships between addiction to certain substances and specific 
      mental disorders: personality disorders with all SUDs; psychotic disorders with 
      cannabis use disorder, but not cocaine use disorder; affective disorders with 
      cocaine use disorder, and anxiety disorders with cannabis use disorder. This study 
      provides preliminary information about the high coexistence in routine clinical 
      practice of addictive disorders and other mental disorders in different treatment 
      settings in Spain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Addressing multiple substance use disorders (SUDs) in primary care-based 
      screening and intervention may improve SUD treatment access, engagement, and 
      outcomes. To inform such efforts, research is needed on the prevalence and patterns 
      of multiple SUDs among primary care patients. METHODS: Data were analyzed from a 
      sample of 2000 adult (aged ≥ 18) primary care patients recruited for a multisite 
      National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) study (CTN-0059). 
      Past-year DSM-5 SUDs (tobacco, alcohol, and drug) were assessed by the modified 
      Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Prevalence and correlates of multiple 
      versus single SUDs were examined. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to explore 
      patterns of multiple SUDs. RESULTS: Multiple SUDs were found among the majority of 
      participants with SUD for alcohol, cannabis, prescription opioids, cocaine, and 
      heroin. Participants who were male, ages 26-34, less educated, and unemployed had 
      increased odds of multiple SUDs compared to one SUD. Having multiple SUDs was 
      associated with greater severity of tobacco or alcohol use disorder. LCA of the 
      sample identified three classes: class 1 (83.7%) exhibited low prevalence of all 
      SUDs; class 2 (12.0%) had high-moderate prevalence of SUDs for tobacco, alcohol, and 
      cannabis; class 3 (4.3%) showed high prevalence of SUD for tobacco, opioids, and 
      cocaine. LCA-defined classes were distinguished by sex, age, race, education, and 
      employment status. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that primary care physicians should 
      be aware of multiple SUDs when planning treatment, especially among adults who are 
      male, younger, less educated, or unemployed. Interventions that target multiple SUDs 
      warrant future investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Network scale-up is one of the most important indirect methods of 
      estimating the size of clandestine populations and people with high-risk behaviors. 
      The present study is an indirect estimation of the population size of students with 
      high-risk behaviors in select universities of medical sciences. METHODS: A total of 
      801 students from two University of Medical Sciences at Tehran and Alborz University 
      of Medical Sciences were selected through convenience sampling. Six subgroups of 
      high-risk behaviors were examined in the study, including Tramadol use, cannabis 
      use, opium use, alcohol consumption, extramarital heterosexual intercourse, and 
      heterosexual intercourse in return for money. To estimate the social network size in 
      the study population, each participant was asked to name their close student friends 
      from the two select universities. Data were collected using a checklist designed for 
      this purpose. RESULTS: The participants' mean number of close friends from the 
      selected medical universities was C = 8.14 (CI: 7.54-8.75). Within these social 
      networks, friends with extramarital heterosexual intercourse (5.53%) and friends who 
      consumed alcohol (4.92%) had the highest frequency, and friends who used opium 
      (0.33%) had the lowest frequency. The variables of age, gender, marital status, type 
      of residence and academic degree were significantly related to the likelihood of 
      having close friends with certain high-risk behaviors (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      According to the results obtained, alcohol consumption and extramarital heterosexual 
      intercourse are very common among students. Special HIV prevention programs are 
      therefore necessary for this age group.

TI  - Functional Neuroimaging Predictors of Self-Reported Psychotic Symptoms in 
      Adolescents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the neural correlates of psychotic-like 
      experiences in youths during tasks involving inhibitory control, reward 
      anticipation, and emotion processing. A secondary aim was to test whether these 
      neurofunctional correlates of risk were predictive of psychotic symptoms 2 years 
      later. METHOD: Functional imaging responses to three paradigms-the stop-signal, 
      monetary incentive delay, and faces tasks-were collected in youths at age 14, as 
      part of the IMAGEN study. At baseline, youths from London and Dublin sites were 
      assessed on psychotic-like experiences, and those reporting significant experiences 
      were compared with matched control subjects. Significant brain activity differences 
      between the groups were used to predict, with cross-validation, the presence of 
      psychotic symptoms in the context of mood fluctuation at age 16, assessed in the 
      full sample. These prediction analyses were conducted with the London-Dublin 
      subsample (N=246) and the full sample (N=1,196). RESULTS: Relative to control 
      subjects, youths reporting psychotic-like experiences showed increased 
      hippocampus/amygdala activity during processing of neutral faces and reduced 
      dorsolateral prefrontal activity during failed inhibition. The most prominent 
      regional difference for classifying 16-year-olds with mood fluctuation and psychotic 
      symptoms relative to the control groups (those with mood fluctuations but no 
      psychotic symptoms and those with no mood symptoms) was hyperactivation of the 
      hippocampus/amygdala, when controlling for baseline psychotic-like experiences and 
      cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: The results stress the importance of the limbic network's 
      increased response to neutral facial stimuli as a marker of the extended psychosis 
      phenotype. These findings might help to guide early intervention strategies for 
      at-risk youths.

TI  - Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiling Reveals Epigenetic Changes in the Rat Nucleus 
      Accumbens Associated With Cross-Generational Effects of Adolescent THC Exposure.
PG  - 2993-3005
LID - 10.1038/npp.2015.155 [doi]
AB  - Drug exposure during critical periods of development is known to have lasting 
      effects, increasing one's risk for developing mental health disorders. Emerging 
      evidence has also indicated the possibility for drug exposure to even impact 
      subsequent generations. Our previous work demonstrated that adolescent exposure to 
      Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of marijuana 
      (Cannabis sativa), in a Long-Evans rat model affects reward-related behavior and 
      gene regulation in the subsequent (F1) generation unexposed to the drug. Questions, 
      however, remained regarding potential epigenetic consequences. In the current study, 
      using the same rat model, we employed Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite 
      Sequencing to interrogate the epigenome of the nucleus accumbens, a key brain area 
      involved in reward processing. This analysis compared 16 animals with parental THC 
      exposure and 16 without to characterize relevant systems-level changes in DNA 
      methylation. We identified 1027 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated 
      with parental THC exposure in F1 adults, each represented by multiple CpGs. These 
      DMRs fell predominantly within introns, exons, and intergenic intervals, while 
      showing a significant depletion in gene promoters. From these, we identified a 
      network of DMR-associated genes involved in glutamatergic synaptic regulation, which 
      also exhibited altered mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens. These data provide 
      novel insight into drug-related cross-generational epigenetic effects, and serve as 
      a useful resource for investigators to explore novel neurobiological systems 
      underlying drug abuse vulnerability.

TI  - Problem opioid use and HIV primary care engagement among hospitalized people who use 
      drugs and/or alcohol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing public health concern around the potential impact of 
      the opioid crisis on efforts to eradicate HIV. This secondary analysis seeks to 
      determine if those who report opioids as their primary problem drug compared to 
      those who report other drugs and/or alcohol differ in engagement in HIV primary care 
      among a sample of hospitalized people with HIV (PWH) who use drugs and/or alcohol, a 
      traditionally marginalized and difficult to engage population key to ending the HIV 
      epidemic. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 801 participants (67% male; 75% 
      Black, non-Hispanic; mean age 44.2) with uncontrolled HIV and reported drug and/or 
      alcohol use were recruited from 11 hospitals around the U.S. in cities with high HIV 
      prevalence from 2012 to 2014 for a multisite clinical trial to improve HIV viral 
      suppression. METHODS: A generalized linear model compared those who reported opioids 
      as their primary problem drug to those who reported other problem drugs and/or 
      alcohol on their previous engagement in HIV primary care, controlling for age, sex, 
      race, education, income, any previous drug and/or alcohol treatment, length of time 
      since diagnosis, and study site. RESULTS: A total of 95 (11.9%) participants 
      reported opioids as their primary problem drug. In adjusted models, those who 
      reported opioids were significantly less likely to have ever engaged in HIV primary 
      care than those who reported no problem drug use (adjusted risk ratio, ARR = 0.84, 
      95% Confidence Interval, CI 0.73, 0.98), stimulants (ARR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.74, 0.95), 
      and polydrug use but no alcohol (ARR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.68, 0.93). While not 
      statistically significant, the trend in the estimates of the remaining drug and/or 
      alcohol categories (alcohol, cannabis, polydrug use with alcohol, and [but excluding 
      the estimate for] other), point to a similar phenomena-those who identify opioids as 
      their primary problem drug are engaging in HIV primary care less. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings suggest that for hospitalized PWH who use drugs and/or alcohol, tailored 
      and expanded efforts are especially needed to link those who report problem opioid 
      use to HIV primary care. Trial registration This study was funded by National 
      Institutes of Health (NIH) grant: U10-DA01372011 (Project HOPE-Hospital Visit as 
      Opportunity for Prevention and Engagement for HIV-Infected Drug Users; Metsch); 
      which is also a registered clinical trial under the Clinical Trials Network 
      (CTN-0049). The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not

TI  - Youth in transition: Study protocol of a prospective cohort study into the long-term 
      course of addiction, mental health problems and social functioning in youth entering 
      addiction treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent in the general population, 
      tend to follow a chronic course, are associated with many individual and social 
      problems, and often have their onset in adolescence. However, the knowledge base 
      from prospective population surveys and treatment-outcome studies on the course of 
      SUD in adolescents is limited at best. The present study aims to fill this gap and 
      focuses on a subgroup that is particularly at risk for chronicity: adolescents in 
      addiction treatment. We will investigate the rate of persistent SUD and its 
      predictors longitudinally from adolescence to young adulthood among youth with DSM-5 
      SUD from the start of their addiction treatment to 2 and 4 years following 
      treatment-entry. In addition to SUD, we will investigate the course of comorbid 
      mental disorders, social functioning, and quality of life and their association with 
      SUD over time. METHODS/DESIGN: In a naturalistic, multi-center prospective cohort 
      design, we will include youths (n = 420), who consecutively enter addiction 
      treatment at ten participating organizations in the Netherlands. Inclusion is 
      prestratified by treatment organization, to ensure a nationally representative 
      sample. Eligible youths are 16 to 22 years old and seek help for a primary DSM-5 
      cannabis, alcohol, cocaine or amphetamine use disorder. Assessments focus on 
      lifetime and current substance use and SUD, non-SUD mental disorders, family 
      history, life events, social functioning, treatment history, quality of life, 
      chronic stress indicators (hair cortisol) and neuropsychological tests (computerized 
      executive function tasks) and are conducted at baseline, end of treatment, and 2 and 
      4 years post-baseline. Baseline data and treatment data (type, intensity, duration) 
      will be used to predict outcome - persistence of or desistance from SUD. DISCUSSION: 
      There are remarkably few prospective studies worldwide that investigated the course 
      of SUD in adolescents in addiction treatment for longer than 1 year. We are 
      confident that the Youth in Transition study will further our understanding of 
      determinants and consequences of persistent SUD among high-risk adolescents during 
      the critical transition from adolescence to young adulthood. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The

      Downstream Synaptic Excitation, and Signaling to Migrating Neurons.
PG  - 6133-6145
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1931-19.2020 [doi]
AB  - The endocannabinoid system plays important roles in brain development, but 
      mechanistic studies have focused on neuronal differentiation, migration, and 
      synaptogenesis, with less attention to transcellular interactions that coordinate 
      neurodevelopmental processes across developing neural networks. We determined that, 
      in the developing rodent cerebellar cortex (of both sexes), there is a transient 
      window when the dominant brain cannabinoid receptor, CB1R, is expressed on afferent 
      terminals instead of output neuron Purkinje cell synapses that dominate the adult 
      cerebellum. Activation of these afferent CB1Rs suppresses synaptic transmission onto 
      developing granule cells, and consequently also suppresses excitation of downstream 
      neurons in the developing cortical network, including nonsynaptic, migrating 
      neurons. Application of a CB1R antagonist during afferent stimulation trains and 
      depolarizing voltage steps caused a significant, sustained potentiation of synaptic 
      amplitude. Our data demonstrate that transiently expressed afferent CB1Rs regulate 
      afferent synaptic strength during synaptogenesis, which enables coordinated 
      dampening of transcortical developmental signals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The 
      endogenous cannabinoid system plays diverse roles in brain development, which, 
      combined with the rapidly changing legal and medical status of cannabis-related 
      compounds, makes understanding how exogenous cannabinoids affect brain development 
      an important biomedical objective. The cerebellum is a key brain region in a variety 
      of neurodevelopmental disorders, and the adult cerebellum has one of the highest 
      expression levels of CB1R, but little is known about CB1R in the developing 
      cerebellum. Here we report a developmentally distinct expression and function of 
      CB1R in the cerebellum, in which endogenous or exogenous activation of CB1Rs 
      modifies afferent synaptic strength and coordinated downstream network signaling. 
      These findings have implications for recreational and medical use of exogenous 
      cannabinoids by pregnant and breastfeeding women.

TI  - Illicit substance use after release from prison among formerly incarcerated primary 
      care patients: a cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 80% of people in jail or prison report having used illicit 
      substances in their lifetimes. After release from incarceration, resumption of 
      substance use carries risks, including parole revocation, exacerbation of mental 
      health conditions, transmission of infectious diseases, and drug overdose. METHODS: 
      This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the Transitions Clinic Network 
      (TCN, www.transitionsclinic.org ), a multi-site prospective longitudinal cohort 
      study of post-incarceration medical care. We investigated substance use among 
      adults, with at least one chronic health condition or age ≥ 50 years, who had been 
      recently released from incarceration and initiated care at a TCN site. Our primary 
      outcome was any self-reported illicit substance use (heroin or other opioids, 
      cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, hallucinogens, MDMA, or illicit use of prescription 
      medications) following release from incarceration. Alcohol use post-release was a 
      secondary outcome. Using multivariable logistic regression, we also explored factors 
      associated with illicit substance use. RESULTS: Among 751 participants, median age 
      was 47; participants were mostly male (85%), non-white (47% black, 30% Hispanic), 
      and on parole (80%). The proportion of participants reporting any illicit substance 
      use and any alcohol use soon after release from incarceration was 18% and 23%, 
      respectively. In multivariable regression, variables significantly associated with 
      post-release illicit substance use were male gender (aOR = 3.91, 95% CI: 1.73-8.81), 
      housing with friends or family (aOR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.20-9.28), years incarcerated 
      during latest prison term (aOR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.98), weeks elapsed before 
      engagement with TCN (aOR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.10), being on parole (aOR = 0.58, 
      95% CI: 0.34-0.99), and having a drug use disorder (aOR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.40-3.68). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals seeking medical care after release from 
      incarceration, self-reported substance use was lower than previously reported 
      estimates of post-incarceration substance use. Known risk factors, such as male 
      gender and having a drug use disorder, were associated with illicit substance use, 
      as were novel risk factors, such as less supervised housing. Though illicit 
      substance use post-incarceration can carry severe consequences, treatment and 
      surveillance interventions should be targeted toward individuals with greatest risk.

TI  - Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS): Psychometric Quality of the Gold Standard 
      for Tic Assessment Based on the Large-Scale EMTICS Study.
PG  - 626459
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.626459 [doi]
LID - 626459
AB  - The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) is a clinician-rated instrument 
      considered as the gold standard for assessing tics in patients with Tourette's 
      Syndrome and other tic disorders. Previous psychometric investigations of the YGTSS 
      exhibit different limitations such as small sample sizes and insufficient methods. 
      To overcome these shortcomings, we used a subsample of the large-scale "European 
      Multicentre Tics in Children Study" (EMTICS) including 706 children and adolescents 
      with a chronic tic disorder and investigated convergent, discriminant and factorial 
      validity, as well as internal consistency of the YGTSS. Our results confirm 
      acceptable convergent and good to very good discriminant validity, respectively, 
      indicated by a sufficiently high correlation of the YGTSS total tic score with the 
      Clinical Global Impression Scale for tics (r (s) = 0.65) and only low to medium 
      correlations with clinical severity ratings of attention deficit/hyperactivity 
      symptoms (r (s) = 0.24), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (r (s) = 27) as well as 
      internalizing symptoms (r (s) = 0.27). Internal consistency was found to be 
      acceptable (Ω = 0.58 for YGTSS total tic score). A confirmatory factor analysis 
      supports the concept of the two factors "motor tics" and "phonic tics," but still 
      demonstrated just a marginal model fit (root mean square error of approximation = 
      0.09 [0.08; 0.10], comparative fit index = 0.90, and Tucker Lewis index = 0.87). A 
      subsequent analysis of local misspecifications revealed correlated measurement 
      errors, suggesting opportunities for improvement regarding the item wording. In 
      conclusion, our results indicate acceptable psychometric quality of the YGTSS. 
      However, taking the wide use and importance of the YGTSS into account, our results 
      suggest the need for further investigations and improvements of the YGTSS. In 
      addition, our results show limitations of the global severity score as a sum score 
      indicating that the separate use of the total tic score and the impairment rating is 
      more beneficial.

TI  - Post-GWAS analysis of six substance use traits improves the identification and 
      functional interpretation of genetic risk loci.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the functional mechanisms through which genetic 
      loci associated with substance use traits ascertain their effect. This study aims to 
      identify and functionally annotate loci associated with substance use traits based 
      on their role in genetic regulation of gene expression. METHODS: We evaluated 
      expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) from 13 brain regions and whole blood of 
      the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, and from whole blood of the 
      Depression Genes and Networks (DGN) database. The role of single eQTLs was examined 
      for six substance use traits: alcohol consumption (N = 537,349), cigarettes per day 
      (CPD; N = 263,954), former vs. current smoker (N = 312,821), age of smoking 
      initiation (N = 262,990), ever smoker (N = 632,802), and cocaine dependence 
      (N = 4,769). Subsequently, we conducted a gene level analysis of gene expression on 
      these substance use traits using S-PrediXcan. RESULTS: Using an FDR-adjusted p-value 
      <0.05 we found 2,976 novel candidate genetic loci for substance use traits, and 
      identified genes and tissues through which these loci potentially exert their 
      effects. Using S-PrediXcan, we identified significantly associated genes for all 
      substance traits. DISCUSSION: Annotating genes based on transcriptomic regulation 
      improves the identification and functional characterization of candidate loci and 
      genes for substance use traits.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the trend of expenditure on drug-related psychiatric hospital 
      admissions in Maringá, Paraná, Brazil, from 1999 to 2012. METHOD: Ecological time 
      series research with secondary data from the hospital information system of the 
      unified health system ("SIH-SUS"). The records of admissions with a main diagnosis 
      of drug abuse were used to calculate average expenditure. Chapter V of the ICD-10 
      was used to classify the most frequent diagnoses, namely abuse of alcohol, cannabis, 
      cocaine, and psychoactive substances. The trend was expressed using a polynomial 
      regression model. RESULTS: Average expenditure showed an increasing trend for 
      cocaine and other psychoactive substances, and a decreasing trend for cannabis. 
      Average expenditure for illicit drugs increased significantly. CONCLUSION: The 
      scarcity of economic studies on this subject calls for national studies that address 
      expenditure with drug-related hospital admission to promote the implementation of a 
      psychosocial, outpatient and hospital care network in accord with public healthcare 
      expenditure.

TI  - Insomnia Symptoms in Patients With Substance Use Disorders During Detoxification and 
      Associated Clinical Features.
PG  - 540022

LID - 540022
AB  - Background: Insomnia is highly prevalent in patients with substance use disorders 
      (SUD), and it has been related to a worse course of addiction. Insomnia during 
      detoxification in a hospital has not been adequately studied. This study aims to 
      compare sociodemographic, clinical, and psychopathological characteristics of SUD 
      patients undergoing a detoxification program, by comorbidity and insomnia symptoms. 
      Methodology: We recruited 481 patients who received pharmacological and 
      psychotherapeutic treatment for detoxification. They were evaluated through 
      semi-structured interviews, standardized questionnaires, and a specific sleep log. A 
      bivariate and multivariate analysis of the data was performed. Results: Insomnia was 
      reported by 66.5% patients, with sleep-maintenance insomnia the most frequent issue, 
      followed by early morning awakening and sleep-onset insomnia. Patients with alcohol 
      use disorder and cannabis use disorder had higher prevalence of sleep-onset 
      insomnia. Patients with cocaine and heroin use disorder had higher prevalence of 
      sleep-maintenance insomnia. Independent factors that allowed the identification of 
      insomnia symptoms included being female (OR: 3.43), polysubstance use (OR: 2.85), 
      comorbid anxiety disorder (OR: 2.02), and prior admission for detoxification (OR: 
      1.22). Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms are very prevalent in patients admitted for 
      detoxification. The diagnosis and therapeutic strategies for the insomnia symptoms 
      should be improved, especially in women and in patients with greater addiction 
      severity and with anxiety disorders.

TI  - Prevalence of HIV Viral Load Suppression Among Psychiatric Inpatients with Comorbid 
      Substance Use Disorders.
PG  - 1146-1153
LID - 10.1007/s10597-018-0284-2 [doi]
AB  - A consistently suppressed viral load enables HIV (+) patients to live longer, 
      healthier lives and reduces the probability of transmitting the virus. Since the 
      prevalence of HIV is four times higher among those with psychiatric disorders than 
      in the general population, it is likely that this group would also have greater 
      difficulty remaining in care and achieving viral suppression. A secondary data 
      analysis utilizing screening data from the Preventing AIDS Through Health (PATH) for 
      Triples (PFT) Study were examined to assess HIV load suppression among 254 
      psychiatric inpatients with comorbid substance use disorders in Philadelphia. Viral 
      load results from the past 12 months were obtained from medical records for 63 
      inpatients identified as HIV (+). The sample was predominately African American 
      (76%), male (56%), and the average age was 43 years. Psychiatric disorders included 
      depression (64%), schizophrenia (21%), and bipolar disorder (13%) with patients 
      reporting use of alcohol (73%), cocaine (64%), cannabis (29%) and opioids (16%) 
      prior to admission. Among this high risk sample of HIV (+) patients, about one-half 
      (52%) achieved viral suppression, with recent opioid users six times more likely to 
      have a detectable viral load than non-opioid users (OR 6.0; CI 1.1-31.7, p = .035). 
      The 52% viral load suppression rate among psychiatric inpatient was higher than 
      expected, given that the CDC's national suppression rate among those diagnosed with 
      HIV in the general population is 58%. However, individuals with mental illness and 
      substance use disorders require constant surveillance, monitoring, and supportive 
      services to achieve viral suppression. Many of those who were virally suppressed 
      were engaged in Philadelphia's extensive treatment network, whereas those who were 
      detectable and enrolled in the PFT intervention were often homeless with unstable 
      psychiatric symptoms and current substance use disorders, particularly opioid abuse.

TI  - Cannabinoid Exposure via Lactation in Rats Disrupts Perinatal Programming of the 
      Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Trajectory and Select Early-Life Behaviors.
PG  - 666-677
LID - S0006-3223(19)31662-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.08.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis usage is increasing with its widespread legalization. Cannabis 
      use by mothers during lactation transfers active cannabinoids to the developing 
      offspring during this critical period and alters postnatal neurodevelopment. A key 
      neurodevelopmental landmark is the excitatory to inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA) switch caused by reciprocal changes in expression ratios of the K(+)/Cl(-) 
      transporters potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and sodium-potassium-chloride 
      transporter (NKCC1). METHODS: Rat dams were treated with Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol 
      or a synthetic cannabinoid during the first 10 days of postnatal development, and 
      experiments were then conducted in the offspring exposed to these drugs via 
      lactation. The network influence of GABA transmission was analyzed using 
      cell-attached recordings. KCC2 and NKCC1 levels were determined using Western blot 
      and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Ultrasonic vocalization and 
      homing behavioral experiments were carried out at relevant time points. RESULTS: 
      Treating rat dams with cannabinoids during early lactation retards transcriptional 
      upregulation and expression of KCC2, thereby delaying the GABA switch in pups of 
      both sexes. This perturbed trajectory was corrected by the NKCC1 antagonist 
      bumetanide and accompanied by alterations in ultrasonic vocalization without changes 
      in homing behavior. Neurobehavioral deficits were prevented by CB(1) receptor 
      antagonism during maternal exposure, showing that the CB(1) receptor underlies the 
      cannabinoid-induced alterations. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal how perinatal 
      cannabinoid exposure retards an early milestone of development, delaying the 
      trajectory of GABA's polarity transition and altering early-life communication.

TI  - Relevance of well-being, resilience, and health-related quality of life to mental 
      health profiles of European adolescents: results from a cross-sectional analysis of 
      the school-based multinational UPRIGHT project.
PG  - 279-291

AB  - PURPOSE: The existing evidence suggests that a complete evaluation of mental health 
      should incorporate both psychopathology and mental well-being indicators. However, 
      few studies categorize European adolescents into subgroups based on such complete 
      mental health data. This study used the data on mental well-being and symptoms of 
      mental and behavioral disorders to explore the mental health profiles of adolescents 
      in Europe. METHODS: Data collected from adolescents (N = 3767; mean age 12.4 
      [SD = 0.9]) from five European countries supplied the information on their mental 
      well-being (personal resilience, school resilience, quality of life, and mental 
      well-being) and mental and behavioral disorder symptoms (anxiety, depression, 
      stress, bullying, cyber-bullying, and use of tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis). 
      Multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis were combined to classify the 
      youths into mental health profiles. RESULTS: Adolescents were categorized into three 
      mental health profiles. The "poor mental health" profile (6%) was characterized by 
      low levels of well-being and moderate symptoms of mental disorders. The "good mental 
      health" profile group (26%) showed high well-being and few symptoms of mental 
      disorders, and the "intermediate mental health" profile (68%) was characterized by 
      average well-being and mild-to-moderate symptoms of mental disorders. Groups with 
      higher levels of well-being and fewer symptoms of mental disorders showed lower 
      rates of behavioral problems. Mental well-being indicators strongly contributed to 
      this classification. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with the "intermediate" or "poor" 
      mental health profiles may benefit from interventions to improve mental health. 
      Implications for school-based interventions are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER

TI  - Preferences for Treatment Setting by Substance Users in India.
PG  - 42-5
LID - 10.4103/0253-7176.175105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug and alcohol use is a growing public health concern for India. 
      Treatment services delivery for substance use disorders is available through three 
      sectors viz. Government (GO) centres under Ministry of Health and FW, Non-Government 
      (NGO) under Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the private sector. 
      Information on ttreatment utilisation and preferences of treatment settings by 
      substance users are not available for India. METHODS: A performa was filled up 
      prospectively for each consecutive new patient seeking treatment for drug/alcohol 
      use (excluding tobacco) at De-addiction centres funded by MOH&FW; NGOs under MoSJE 
      and private psychiatrists between 15(th) July to 15(th) October, 2011. All data 
      available for 182 drug using persons from private, 1228 persons from 35 NGOs and 
      1700 persons from GO organizations were entered into SPSS-21.0, data quality checks 
      performed and analysed. RESULTS: There was a variance in the population profile in 
      the three sectors providing treatment delivery for substance users in India. 
      Treatment seeking for illicit drugs (heroin, opiates and cannabis) was higher in GO 
      sector; injection drug use was higher in NGO sector while alcohol was higher in 
      private sector. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening linkages between GO and NGO sector is 
      important for an improved coverage and quality of treatment services in the country. 
      The Andersen's Behavioural Model as theoretical background to clarify some issues in 
      analyzing with larger datasets is warranted.

TI  - Gender Differences in Internalizing Symptoms and Suicide Risk Among Men and Women 
      Seeking Treatment for Cannabis Use Disorder from Late Adolescence to Middle 
      Adulthood.
PG  - 16-22
LID - S0740-5472(16)00044-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jsat.2016.01.012 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis continues to rise in popularity as the perception of its harmfulness 
      decreases and evidence of its deleterious developmental effect increases. While 
      internalizing distress and suicide risk have been linked with cannabis use problems 
      [DSM-5 cannabis use disorder (CUD); DSM-IV cannabis abuse and dependence] it remains 
      unclear how this association varies over the course of development in 
      treatment-seeking men and women. The current study utilized the National Drug Abuse 
      Treatment Clinical Trials Network (NIDA CTN) to conduct a cross-sectional comparison 
      of internalizing distress and suicide risk among men (n=437) and women (n=163) 
      spanning ages 18-50 who met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Interactions between gender and 
      developmental stage (i.e., late adolescence, early adulthood, and middle adulthood) 
      were observed for suicide risk and anxiety but not depression problems. 
      Specifically, women seeking CUD treatment in late adolescence and middle adulthood 
      exhibited significantly higher rates of anxiety and suicide risk compared to men 
      seeking treatment during the same developmental stages. Internalizing distress and 
      suicide risk did not differ between treatment-seeking men and women in the early 
      adult stage. Overall, results suggest that the structure of risk for CUD may differ 
      in men and women across the lifespan and that women presenting for CUD treatment 
      during late adolescence and middle adulthood may uniquely benefit from intervention 
      designed to address these elevations in anxiety and suicide risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the autonomic nervous system and neurobehavioral response to a 
      sustained visual attention challenge in 1-month-old infants with prenatal substance 
      exposure. STUDY DESIGN: We measured heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and 
      neurobehavior during sustained visual orientation tasks included in the Neonatal 
      Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale in 1129 1-month-old infants with 
      prenatal substance exposure. Four groups were compared: infants with prenatal 
      cocaine and opiate exposure, infants with cocaine exposure, infants with opiate 
      exposure, and infants with exposure to other substances (ie, alcohol, marijuana, and 
      tobacco). RESULTS: The infants with prenatal exposure to both cocaine and opiates 
      had the highest heart rates and lowest levels of respiratory sinus arrhythmia during 
      a sustained visual attention challenge compared with the other 3 groups. Infants 
      with prenatal cocaine and opiate exposure had poorer quality of movement and more 
      hypertonicity during the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale 
      examination. They also had more nonoptimal reflexes and stress/abstinence signs 
      compared with infants with prenatal exposure to cocaine only and those with prenatal 
      exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. CONCLUSION: Problems with arousal 
      regulation were identified in infants with prenatal substance exposure. Autonomic 
      dysregulation has been implicated as a mechanism by which these difficulties occur. 
      Our results suggest that infants with prenatal exposure to both cocaine and opiates 
      have the greatest autonomic response to the challenge of a sustained visual 
      attention task, possibly putting these infants at risk for problems associated with 
      physiologic and behavioral regulation, a necessary prerequisite for early learning.

LID - 10.1186/1747-597X-9-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically substance misuse has been relatively common in western 
      countries, but comparatively few Finns report drug use. The Drugs 2020 study aimed 
      at foreseeing changes in the drug situation in Finland by the year 2020. METHODS: 
      The Delphi method was used, utilizing drug experts of the EU national network in 
      Finland. RESULTS: Marked growth was foreseen in drug use, especially in synthetic 
      designer drugs and misuse of medicinal drugs. Significant increase was also expected 
      in growing cannabis at home. However, the control of drug market was expected to 
      shift more into the hands of organized crime. No consensus was reached on how drug 
      prices will develop in the time period. Drug use is likely to remain punishable 
      although the use and possession of cannabis may be treated less severely. It seems 
      likely that health and social services resources will be directed towards medicinal 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Foresight can be utilized in preparing for the future; 
      desirable developments can be fostered, and measures can be taken to curb probable 
      but undesirable lines of development. Based on the results of this study, the 
      experts' view is that it is highly likely that the Finnish society will have to 
      prepare for an increase in the demand for drug-related care, both in terms of 
      content of the care and financing the services. Also, the forecasted increase in the 
      role of legal prescription medicine used as intoxicants will call for efforts not 
      only in changing prescription practices but in border and police control measures, 
      as well. Parallel developments have been foreseen in the UK and Sweden, and it is 
      likely that similar trends will actualize also in other western countries.

      with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) attending Canadian pain clinics. The study 
      describes the demographics, pain characteristics and the diagnostic classification 
      profile of such patients attending a university-affiliated community-based pain 
      clinic in the Greater Toronto Area. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study based 
      on 644 unique consecutive CNCP patients assessed between January 2016 and December 
      2017. RESULTS: The female/male ratio was 1.6:1; 80% were younger than 65 years; 43% 
      held some form of employment (full-time, part-time or self employment); median pain 
      duration was 3 years; car accidents and medical conditions accounted for 28 and 27% 
      of pain onset, respectively; 34% had four or more distinct areas of pain; and low 
      back pain (LBP) was the most prevalent site (66%), but was the sole site of pain in 
      less than a third of these patients. Age was positively associated with LBP 
      prevalence. Self-reported health service utilization (visits to the emergency room, 
      pain physician or psychologist) increased with patient psychopathology. Cannabis was 
      used by 15% of the cohort and opioids by 34.5%, with only one in six opioid users 
      exceeding 90 mg of morphine equivalent dose per day. Comparison of our data to three 
      previously published studies from other Canadian pain clinics demonstrated both 
      similarities and substantial differences between the populations. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study highlights regional differences between CNCP population phenotypes. 
      Recognition of biomedical, psychological and socio-environmental factors affecting 
      pain should be considered for patient stratification and rational approaches to 
      treatment, as "one size treatment does not fit all".

TI  - Social network influences on smoking, drinking and drug use in secondary school: 
      centrifugal and centripetal forces.
PG  - 699-715

AB  - We explore how school experiences and social networks structure young people's 
      substance use in different institutional contexts. The concepts of 'selection' and 
      'influence' are situated within the context of bounded agency, counter-school 
      cultures and Bourdieusian notions of capital. We employed individual and group 
      interviews, network-mapping, and observations at two contrasting English secondary 
      schools. Both schools were characterised by extended social network structures that 
      appeared to influence patterns of substance use, although the mechanisms via which 
      this occurred varied according to school context. At Grange House school (suburban 
      context) a minority of students from disadvantaged families were alienated by the 
      attainment-focused regime, marginalised by a strong peer-led centrifugal force 
      pushing them outwards, and substance use was an alternative source of bonding and 
      identity for these students. In contrast, at North Street a centripetal force 
      operated whereby the majority of students were pulled towards highly-visible, 
      normative markers of 'safe', 'road culture', such as cannabis use and 
      gang-involvement, as they attempted to fit in and survive in an inner-city school 
      environment. We conclude that health inequalities may be reproduced through these 
      distinctive centrifugal and centripetal forces in different institutional contexts, 
      and this should be the focus of quantitative examination in the UK and elsewhere.

TI  - Supporting the Needs of Adolescents and Young Adults: Integrated Palliative Care and 
      Psychiatry Clinic for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13040770 [doi]
LID - 770
AB  - Clinical guidelines aimed at cancer care for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) 
      encourage early integration of palliative care, yet there are scarce data to support 
      these recommendations. We conducted a retrospective chart review of AYA patients, 
      aged 15 to 39 years, who were referred to the Integrated AYA Palliative Care and 
      Psychiatry Clinic (IAPCPC) at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between May 2017 
      and November 2019 (n = 69). Demographic data, symptom prevalence, change in symptom 
      scores between baseline consultation and first follow-up, and intensity of 
      end-of-life care were collected from the patients' medical charts, analyzed, and 
      reported. Of the 69 patients, 59% were female, and sarcoma was the most common 
      cancer. A majority of patients had at least one symptom scored as moderate to 
      severe; tiredness, pain, and sleep problems were the highest scored symptoms. More 
      than one-third used medical cannabis to manage their symptoms. Symptom scores 
      improved in 61% after the first clinic visit. Out of the 69 patients, 50 (72.5%) had 
      died by October 2020, with a median time between the initial clinic referral and 
      death of 5 months (range 1-32). Three patients (6%) received chemotherapy, and eight 
      (16%) were admitted to an intensive care unit during the last month of life. In 
      conclusion, AYAs with advanced cancer have a high burden of palliative and 
      psychosocial symptoms. Creating a specialized AYA palliative care clinic integrated 
      with psychiatry showed promising results in improving symptom scores and end-of-life 
      planning.

TI  - Characterizing the followers and tweets of a marijuana-focused Twitter handle.
PG  - e157
LID - 10.2196/jmir.3247 [doi]
LID - e157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Twitter is a popular social media forum for sharing personal 
      experiences, interests, and opinions. An improved understanding of the discourse on 
      Twitter that encourages marijuana use can be helpful for tailoring and targeting 
      online and offline prevention messages. OBJECTIVES: The intent of the study was to 
      assess the content of "tweets" and the demographics of followers of a popular 
      pro-marijuana Twitter handle (@stillblazingtho). METHODS: We assessed the sentiment 
      and content of tweets (sent from May 1 to December 31, 2013), as well as the 
      demographics of consumers that follow a popular pro-marijuana Twitter handle 
      (approximately 1,000,000 followers) using Twitter analytics from Demographics Pro. 
      This analytics company estimates demographic characteristics based on Twitter 
      behavior/usage, relying on multiple data signals from networks, consumption, and 
      language and requires confidence of 95% or above to make an estimate of a single 
      demographic characteristic. RESULTS: A total of 2590 tweets were sent from 
      @stillblazingtho during the 8-month period and 305 (11.78%) replies to another 
      Twitter user were excluded for qualitative analysis. Of the remaining 2285 tweets, 
      1875 (82.06%) were positive about marijuana, 403 (17.64%) were neutral, and 7 
      (0.31%) appeared negative about marijuana. Approximately 1101 (58.72%) of the 
      positive marijuana tweets were perceived as jokes or humorous, 340 (18.13%) implied 
      that marijuana helps you to feel good or relax, 294 (15.68%) mentioned routine, 
      frequent, or heavy use, 193 (10.29%) mentioned blunts, marijuana edibles, or 
      paraphernalia (eg, bongs, vaporizers), and 186 (9.92%) mentioned other risky health 
      behaviors (eg, tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, sex). The majority (699,103/959,143; 
      72.89%) of @stillblazingtho followers were 19 years old or younger. Among people 
      ages 17 to 19 years, @stillblazingtho was in the top 10% of all Twitter handles 
      followed. More followers of @stillblazingtho in the United States were African 
      American (323,107/759,407; 42.55%) or Hispanic (90,732/759,407; 11.95%) than the 
      Twitter median average (African American 22.4%, inter-quartile ratio [IQR] 
      5.1-62.5%; Hispanic 5.4%, IQR 3.0-10.8%) and among Hispanics, @stillblazingtho was 
      in the top 30% of all Twitter handles followed. CONCLUSIONS: Young people are 
      especially responsive to social media influences and often establish substance use 
      patterns during this phase of development. Our findings underscore the need for 
      surveillance efforts to monitor the pro-marijuana content reaching young people on 
      Twitter.

TI  - Long-term sobriety strategies for men with co-occurring disorders.
PG  - 212-9
LID - 10.1080/15504263.2014.961884 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Roughly half of people with severe mental disorders also experience a 
      co-occurring substance use disorder, and recovery from both is a critical objective 
      for health care services. While understanding of abstinence initiation has grown, 
      the strategies people with co-occurring disorders use to maintain sobriety are 
      largely unknown. This article reports strategies for relapse prevention as described 
      by men with co-occurring disorders who achieved one or more years of sobriety. 
      METHODS: We analyzed semi-structured interviews conducted with a sample of 12 men 
      with co-occurring psychosis and substance use disorder who achieved and maintained 
      sobriety for at least one year, supplemented with demographic and diagnostic 
      clinical record data. These men were participating in residential or outpatient 
      treatment at a private, nonprofit integrated treatment clinic. RESULTS: The 12 men 
      were primarily Caucasian (91.7%) and unmarried (100%), and their ages ranged from 23 
      to 42 years. The two most common psychiatric disorders were schizoaffective disorder 
      (n = 4, 33.3%) and bipolar disorder (n = 4, 33.3%), while the two most commonly 
      misused substances were alcohol and cannabis. Qualitative analyses showed that 
      participants maintained sobriety for at least one year by building a supportive 
      community, engaging in productive activities, and carefully monitoring their own 
      attitudes toward substances, mental health, and responsibility. Alcoholics Anonymous 
      might act as a catalyst for building skills. CONCLUSIONS: People with co-occurring 
      disorders who achieve sobriety use a variety of self-management strategies to 
      prevent relapse-seeking support, activities, and a healthy mindset. The findings 
      suggest a relapse prevention model that focuses on social networks, role 
      functioning, and self-monitoring and conceptualizes self-care as critical to 
      extending periods of wellness.

TI  - Management of post-traumatic stress disorder: A protocol for a multiple treatment 
      comparison meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - e17064
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000017064 [doi]
LID - e17064
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most systematic reviews have explored the efficacy of treatments on 
      symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a chronic 
      and often disabling condition. Previous network meta-analysis (NMA) had limitations 
      such as focusing on pharmacological or psychotherapies. Our review is aims to 
      explore the relative effectiveness of both pharmacological and psychotherapies and 
      we will establish the differential efficacy of interventions for PTSD in 
      consideration of both symptom reduction and functional recovery. METHODS: We will 
      conduct a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating treatment 
      interventions for PTSD. We will systematically search Medline, PILOT, Embase, 
      CINHAL, AMED, Psychinfo, Health Star, DARE and CENTRAL to identify trials that: (1) 
      enroll adult patients with PTSD, and (2) randomize them to alternative interventions 
      or an intervention and a placebo/sham arm. Independent reviewers will screen trials 
      for eligibility, assess risk of bias using a modified Cochrane instrument, and 
      extract data. Our outcomes of interest include PTSD symptom reduction, quality of 
      life, functional recovery, social and occupational impairment, return to work and 
      all-cause drop outs. RESULTS: We will conduct frequentist random-effects network 
      meta-analysis to assess relative effects of competing interventions. We will use a 
      priori hypotheses to explore heterogeneity between studies, and assess the certainty 
      of evidence using the GRADE approach. CONCLUSION: This network meta-analysis will 
      determine the comparative effectiveness of therapeutic options for PTSD on both 
      symptom reduction and functional recovery. Our results will be helpful to clinicians 
      and patients with PTSD, by providing a high-quality evidence synthesis to guide 
      shared-care decision making.

TI  - Oral cannabinoid-rich THC/CBD cannabis extract for secondary prevention of 
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a study protocol for a pilot and 
      definitive randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial (CannabisCINV).
PG  - e020745

LID - e020745
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains an important 
      issue for patients receiving chemotherapy despite guideline-consistent antiemetic 
      therapy. Trials using delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-rich (THC) products demonstrate 
      limited antiemetic effect, significant adverse events and flawed study design. 
      Trials using cannabidiol-rich (CBD) products demonstrate improved efficacy and 
      psychological adverse event profile. No definitive trials have been conducted to 
      support the use of cannabinoids for this indication, nor has the potential economic 
      impact of incorporating such regimens into the Australian healthcare system been 
      established. CannabisCINV aims to assess the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness 
      of adding TN-TC11M, an oral THC/CBD extract to guideline-consistent antiemetics in 
      the secondary prevention of CINV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The current multicentre, 1:1 
      randomised cross-over, placebo-controlled pilot study will recruit 80 adult patients 
      with any malignancy, experiencing CINV during moderate to highly emetogenic 
      chemotherapy despite guideline-consistent antiemetics. Patients receive oral 
      TN-TC11M (THC 2.5mg/CBD 2.5 mg) capsules or placebo capsules three times a day on 
      day -1 to day 5 of cycle A of chemotherapy, followed by the alternative drug regimen 
      during cycle B of chemotherapy and the preferred drug regimen during cycle C. The 
      primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects attaining a complete response to 
      CINV. Secondary and tertiary endpoints include regimen tolerability, impact on 
      quality of life and health system resource use. The primary assessment tool is 
      patient diaries, which are filled from day -1 to day 5. A subsequent randomised 
      placebo-controlled parallel phase III trial will recruit a further 250 patients. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by ethics review committees for 
      all participating sites. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and 
      at scientific conferences. DRUG SUPPLY: Tilray. PROTOCOL VERSION: 2.0, 9 June 2017.

TI  - Association between stillbirth and illicit drug use and smoking during pregnancy.
PG  - 113-125
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000052 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare illicit drug and smoking use in pregnancies with and without 
      stillbirth. METHODS: The Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network conducted a 
      case-control study from March 2006 to September 2008, covering more than 90% of 
      deliveries to residents of five a priori-defined geographically diverse regions. The 
      study attempted to include all stillbirths and representative liveborn controls. 
      Umbilical cord samples from cases and controls were collected and frozen for 
      subsequent batch analysis. Maternal serum was collected at delivery and batch 
      analyzed for cotinine. RESULTS: For 663 stillbirth deliveries, 418 (63%) had cord 
      homogenate and 579 (87%) had maternal cotinine assays performed. For 1,932 live 
      birth deliveries, 1,050 (54%) had cord homogenate toxicology and 1,545 (80%) had 
      maternal cotinine assays performed. A positive cord homogenate test for any illicit 
      drug was associated with stillbirth (odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] 1.16-3.27). The most common individual drug was cannabis (OR 2.34 95% CI 
      1.13-4.81), although the effect was partially confounded by smoking. Both maternal 
      self-reported smoking history and maternal serum cotinine levels were associated in 
      a dose-response relationship with stillbirth. Positive serum cotinine less than 3 
      ng/mL and no reported history of smoking (proxy for passive smoke exposure) also 
      were associated with stillbirth (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.24-3.41). CONCLUSION: Cannabis 
      use, smoking, illicit drug use, and apparent exposure to second-hand smoke, 
      separately or in combination, during pregnancy were associated with an increased 
      risk of stillbirth. Because cannabis use may be increasing with increased 
      legalization, the relevance of these findings may increase as well. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: II.

TI  - Data Gathering Bias: Trait Vulnerability to Psychotic Symptoms?
PG  - e0132442
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0132442 [doi]
LID - e0132442
AB  - BACKGROUND: Jumping to conclusions (JTC) is associated with psychotic disorder and 
      psychotic symptoms. If JTC represents a trait, the rate should be (i) increased in 
      people with elevated levels of psychosis proneness such as individuals diagnosed 
      with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and (ii) show a degree of stability over 
      time. METHODS: The JTC rate was examined in 3 groups: patients with first episode 
      psychosis (FEP), BPD patients and controls, using the Beads Task. PANSS, SIS-R and 
      CAPE scales were used to assess positive psychotic symptoms. Four WAIS III subtests 
      were used to assess IQ. RESULTS: A total of 61 FEP, 26 BPD and 150 controls were 
      evaluated. 29 FEP were revaluated after one year. 44% of FEP (OR = 8.4, 95% CI: 
      3.9-17.9) displayed a JTC reasoning bias versus 19% of BPD (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 
      0.8-7.8) and 9% of controls. JTC was not associated with level of psychotic symptoms 
      or specifically delusionality across the different groups. Differences between FEP 
      and controls were independent of sex, educational level, cannabis use and IQ. After 
      one year, 47.8% of FEP with JTC at baseline again displayed JTC. CONCLUSIONS: JTC in 
      part reflects trait vulnerability to develop disorders with expression of psychotic 
      symptoms.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cannabis dependence (CAD) is a serious problem worldwide and is of 
      growing importance in the United States because cannabis is increasingly available 
      legally. Although genetic factors contribute substantially to CAD risk, at present 
      no well-established specific genetic risk factors for CAD have been elucidated. 
      OBJECTIVE: To report findings for DSM-IV CAD criteria from association analyses 
      performed in large cohorts of African American and European American participants 
      from 3 studies of substance use disorder genetics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This genome-wide association study for DSM-IV CAD criterion count was 
      performed in 3 independent substance dependence cohorts (the Yale-Penn Study, Study 
      of Addiction: Genetics and Environment [SAGE], and International Consortium on the 
      Genetics of Heroin Dependence [ICGHD]). A referral sample and volunteers recruited 
      in the community and from substance abuse treatment centers included 6000 African 
      American and 8754 European American participants, including some from small 
      families. Participants from the Yale-Penn Study were recruited from 2000 to 2013. 
      Data were collected for the SAGE trial from 1990 to 2007 and for the ICGHD from 2004 
      to 2009. Data were analyzed from January 2, 2013, to November 9, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Criterion count for DSM-IV CAD. RESULTS: Among the 14 754 
      participants, 7879 were male, 6875 were female, and the mean (SD) age was 39.2 
      (10.2) years. Three independent regions with genome-wide significant 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism associations were identified, considering the largest 
      possible sample. These included rs143244591 (β = 0.54, P = 4.32 × 10-10 for the 
      meta-analysis) in novel antisense transcript RP11-206M11.7;rs146091982 (β = 0.54, 
      P = 1.33 × 10-9 for the meta-analysis) in the solute carrier family 35 member G1 
      gene (SLC35G1); and rs77378271 (β = 0.29, P = 2.13 × 10-8 for the meta-analysis) in 
      the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 gene (CSMD1). Also noted was evidence of 
      genome-level pleiotropy between CAD and major depressive disorder and for an 
      association with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with 
      schizophrenia risk. Several of the genes identified have functions related to 
      neuronal calcium homeostasis or central nervous system development. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: These results are the first, to our knowledge, to identify specific CAD 
      risk alleles and potential genetic factors contributing to the comorbidity of CAD 
      with major depression and schizophrenia.

TI  - Integrating a brief alcohol intervention with tobacco addiction treatment in primary 
      care: qualitative study of health care practitioner perceptions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized trials of complex interventions are increasingly including 
      qualitative components to further understand factors that contribute to their 
      success. In this paper, we explore the experiences of health care practitioners in a 
      province wide smoking cessation program (the Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients 
      program) who participated in the COMBAT trial. This trial examined if the addition 
      of an electronic prompt embedded in a Clinical Decision Support System 
      (CDSS)-designed to prompt practitioners to Screen, provide a Brief intervention and 
      Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to patients who drank alcohol above the amounts 
      recommended by the Canadian Cancer Society guidelines-influenced the proportion of 
      practitioners delivering a brief intervention to their eligible patients. We wanted 
      to understand the factors influencing implementation and acceptability of delivering 
      a brief alcohol intervention for treatment-seeking smokers for health care providers 
      who had access to the CDSS (intervention arm) and those who did not (control arm). 
      METHODS: Twenty-three health care practitioners were selected for a qualitative 
      interview using stratified purposeful sampling (12 from the control arm and 11 from 
      the intervention arm). Interviews were 45 to 90 min in length and conducted by phone 
      using an interview guide that was informed by the National Implementation Research 
      Network's Hexagon tool. Interview recordings were transcribed and coded iteratively 
      between three researchers to achieve consensus on emerging themes. The preliminary 
      coding structure was developed using the National Implementation Research Network's 
      Hexagon Tool framework and data was analyzed using the framework analysis approach. 
      RESULTS: Seventy eight percent (18/23) of the health care practitioners interviewed 
      recognized the need to simultaneously address alcohol and tobacco use. Seventy four 
      percent (17/23), were knowledgeable about the evidence of health risks associated 
      with dual alcohol and tobacco use but 57% (13/23) expressed concerns with using the 
      Canadian Cancer Society guidelines to screen for alcohol use. Practitioners 
      acknowledged the value of adding a validated screening tool to the STOP program's 
      baseline questionnaire (19/23); however, following through with a brief intervention 
      and referral to treatment proved challenging due to lack of training, limited time, 
      and fear of stigmatizing patients. Practitioners in the intervention arm (5/11; 45%) 
      might not follow the recommendations from CDSS if these recommendations are not 
      perceived as beneficial to the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study show 
      that practitioners' beliefs were reflective of the current social norms around 
      alcohol use and this influenced their decision to offer a brief alcohol 
      intervention. Future interventions need to emphasize both organizational and 
      sociocultural factors as part of the design. The results of this study point to the 
      need to change social norms regarding alcohol in order to effectively implement 
      interventions that target both alcohol and tobacco use in primary care clinics.

AB  - Premorbid functioning and cognitive measures may reflect gradients of developmental 
      impairment across diagnostic categories in psychosis. In this study, we sought to 
      examine the associations of current cognition and premorbid adjustment with symptom 
      dimensions in a large first episode psychosis (FEP) sample. We used data from the 
      international EU-GEI study. Bifactor modelling of the Operational Criteria in 
      Studies of Psychotic Illness (OPCRIT) ratings provided general and specific symptom 
      dimension scores. Premorbid Adjustment Scale estimated premorbid social (PSF) and 
      academic adjustment (PAF), and WAIS-brief version measured IQ. A MANCOVA model 
      examined the relationship between symptom dimensions and PSF, PAF, and IQ, having 
      age, sex, country, self-ascribed ethnicity and frequency of cannabis use as 
      confounders. In 785 patients, better PSF was associated with fewer negative 
      (B = -0.12, 95% C.I. -0.18, -0.06, p < 0.001) and depressive (B = -0.09, 95% C.I. 
      -0.15, -0.03, p = 0.032), and more manic (B = 0.07, 95% C.I. 0.01, 0.14, p = 0.023) 
      symptoms. Patients with a lower IQ presented with slightly more negative and 
      positive, and fewer manic, symptoms. Secondary analysis on IQ subdomains revealed 
      associations between better perceptual reasoning and fewer negative (B = -0.09, 95% 
      C.I. -0.17, -0.01, p = 0.023) and more manic (B = 0.10, 95% C.I. 0.02, 0.18, 
      p = 0.014) symptoms. Fewer positive symptoms were associated with better processing 
      speed (B = -0.12, 95% C.I. -0.02, -0.004, p = 0.003) and working memory (B = -0.10, 
      95% C.I. -0.18, -0.01, p = 0.024). These findings suggest that the negative and 
      manic symptom dimensions may serve as clinical proxies of different 
      neurodevelopmental predisposition in psychosis.

      NMDA receptor antagonist injection and to postweaning social isolation.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) continues its development during adolescence and 
      alterations in its structure and function, particularly of inhibitory networks, have 
      been detected in schizophrenic patients. Since cannabis use during adolescence is a 
      risk factor for this disease, our main objective was to investigate whether THC 
      administration during this period might exacerbate alterations in prefrontocortical 
      inhibitory networks in mice subjected to a perinatal injection of MK801 and 
      postweaning social isolation. This double-hit model (DHM) combines a 
      neurodevelopmental manipulation and the exposure to an aversive experience during 
      early life; previous work has shown that DHM mice have important alterations in the 
      structure and connectivity of PFC interneurons. In the present study we found that 
      DHM had reductions in prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (PPI), GAD67 
      expression and cingulate 1 cortex volume. Interestingly, THC by itself induced 
      increases in PPI and decreases in the dendritic complexity of somatostatin 
      expressing interneurons. Both THC and DHM reduced the density of parvalbumin 
      expressing cells surrounded by perineuronal nets and, when combined, they disrupted 
      the ratio between the density of puncta expressing excitatory and inhibitory 
      markers. Our results support previous work showing alterations in parameters 
      involving interneurons in similar animal models and schizophrenic patients. THC 
      treatment does not modify further these parameters, but changes some others related 
      also to interneurons and their plasticity, in some cases in the opposite direction 
      to those induced by the DHM, suggesting a protective effect.

TI  - Twelve-hour before Driving Prevalence of Alcohol and Drug Use among Heavy Vehicle 
      Drivers in South East of Iran Using Network Scale Up.
PG  - 256-261
LID - 10.22122/ahj.v11i4.252 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heavy vehicle drivers spend a great deal of time away from their 
      families. This issue and other difficulties around their job may increase risky 
      behaviors among them. The current study aims to investigate the prevalence of opium 
      drugs, stimulants, cannabis, and alcohol use 12 hours before driving among heavy 
      vehicle drivers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we selected two sites that 
      were in charge of medical examination of drivers and recruited 363 drivers of heavy 
      vehicles (trucks, trailers, and buses). We asked drivers about total number of 
      drivers they knew and number of drivers who experienced use of different types of 
      drugs. The data were analyzed using Network Scale Up Method (NSUM). FINDINGS: Mean 
      of age and job experience was 43.28 ± 10.04 years and 16.07 ± 9.67 years, 
      respectively. The highest and lowest prevalence of drug use related to opium-based 
      drugs at 12.8% to 14.0% and simulants at 1.97% to 2.84%, respectively. The 
      prevalence of alcohol use 12 hours before driving was 4%. CONCLUSION: 12-hour before 
      driving prevalence of opium-based drugs among drivers was high. This might put them 
      in higher risk of road accidents. There is a need to design appropriate educational 
      programs for them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated to what degree environmental exposure (childhood trauma, 
      urbanicity, cannabis use, and discrimination) impacts symptom connectivity using 
      both continuous and categorical measures of psychopathology. METHODS: Outcomes were 
      continuous symptom dimensions of self-reported psychopathology using the Self-report 
      Symptom Checklist-90-R in 3021 participants from The Early Developmental Stages of 
      the Psychopathology (EDSP) study and binary DSM-III-R categories of mental disorders 
      and a binary measure of psychotic symptoms in 7076 participants from The Netherlands 
      Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS-1). For each symptom dimension in 
      the EDSP and mental disorder in the NEMESIS-1 as the dependent variable, regression 
      analyses were carried out including each of the remaining symptom dimensions/mental 
      disorders and its interaction with cumulative environmental risk load (the sum score 
      of environmental exposures) as independent variables. RESULTS: All symptom 
      dimensions in the EDSP and related diagnostic categories in the NEMESIS-1 were 
      strongly associated with each other, and environmental exposures increased the 
      degree of symptom connectivity in the networks in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings showing strong connectivity across symptom dimensions and related binary 
      diagnostic constructs in two independent population cohorts provide further evidence 
      for the conceptualization of psychopathology as a contextually sensitive network of 
      mutually interacting symptoms.

TI  - Does cannabidiol reduce severe behavioural problems in children with intellectual 
      disability? Study protocol for a pilot single-site phase I/II randomised placebo 
      controlled trial.
PG  - e034362
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034362 [doi]
LID - e034362
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe behavioural problems (SBPs) are a common contributor to 
      morbidity and reduced quality of life in children with intellectual disability (ID). 
      Current medication treatment for SBP is associated with a high risk of side effects. 
      Innovative and safe interventions are urgently needed. Anecdotal reports and 
      preliminary research suggest that medicinal cannabis may be effective in managing 
      SBP in children with developmental disabilities. In particular, cannabidiol (CBD) 
      may be a plausible and safe alternative to current medications. Families who are in 
      urgent need of solutions are seeking cannabis for their ID children with SBP. 
      However there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of 
      CBD for SBP. This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of conducting a 
      randomised placebo-controlled trial of CBD to improve SBP in children with ID. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-site, double-blind, parallel-group, 
      randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study of 10 participants comparing 98% CBD oil 
      with placebo in reducing SBP in children aged 8-16 years with ID. Eligible 
      participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg/day or placebo 
      for 8 weeks. Data will be collected regarding the feasibility and acceptability of 
      all study components, including recruitment, drop-out rate, study visit attendance, 
      protocol adherence and the time burden of parent questionnaires. Safety outcomes and 
      adverse events will be recorded. All data will be reported using descriptive 
      statistics. These data will inform the design of a full scale randomised controlled 
      trial to evaluate the efficacy of CBD in this patient group. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This protocol has received ethics approval from the Royal Children's 
      Hospital ethics committee (Human Research Ethics Committee no. 38236). Results will 
      be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, professional networks, conferences 
      and social media. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12618001852246.

TI  - Oral cannabinoids in people living with HIV on effective antiretroviral therapy: CTN 
      PT028-study protocol for a pilot randomised trial to assess safety, tolerability and 
      effect on immune activation.
PG  - e024793
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024793 [doi]
LID - e024793
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV have 
      higher rates of non-infectious chronic diseases. These conditions are driven by 
      relatively high levels of inflammation persisting on ART compared with uninfected 
      individuals. Chronic inflammation also contributes to HIV persistence during ART. 
      Cannabis when taken orally may represent a way to reduce inflammation and strengthen 
      immune responses. Before planning large interventional studies, it is important to 
      ensure that cannabis taken orally is safe and well tolerated in people living with 
      HIV. We propose to conduct a pilot randomised trial to examine the safety and 
      tolerability of cannabis oils containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol 
      (CBD) consumed orally in people living with HIV. We will also measure inflammatory 
      markers, markers of HIV persistence in peripheral blood cells and changes in the 
      gastrointestinal microbiome. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Twenty-six people living with HIV 
      having undetectable viral load for at least 3 years will be randomised to receive 
      TN-TC11LM (THC:CBD in 1:1 ratio) or TN-TC19LM (THC:CBD in 1:9 ratio) capsules daily 
      for 12 weeks. Safety and tolerability of these capsules will be assessed through 
      haematological, hepatic and renal blood tests, face-to-face interviews and 
      questionnaires. Proportions of participants without any signs of significant 
      toxicity (grades 0-2 scores on the WHO toxicity scale) and who complete the study, 
      as well as scores on quality of life and mood will be examined using descriptive 
      statistics. The effects on inflammatory markers, markers of peripheral blood 
      reservoir size and effect on the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome will 
      be assessed before and after study completion. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study 
      has been approved by the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. 
      A Data Safety Monitor will review safety information at regular intervals. The final 
      manuscript will be submitted to an open-access journal within 6 months of study 
      completion. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03550352.

TI  - Estimating Exposome Score for Schizophrenia Using Predictive Modeling Approach in 
      Two Independent Samples: The Results From the EUGEI Study.
PG  - 960-965
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbz054 [doi]
AB  - Exposures constitute a dense network of the environment: exposome. Here, we argue 
      for embracing the exposome paradigm to investigate the sum of nongenetic "risk" and 
      show how predictive modeling approaches can be used to construct an exposome score 
      (ES; an aggregated score of exposures) for schizophrenia. The training dataset 
      consisted of patients with schizophrenia and controls, whereas the independent 
      validation dataset consisted of patients, their unaffected siblings, and controls. 
      Binary exposures were cannabis use, hearing impairment, winter birth, bullying, and 
      emotional, physical, and sexual abuse along with physical and emotional neglect. We 
      applied logistic regression (LR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), the least absolute 
      shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Ridge penalized classification models 
      to the training dataset. ESs, the sum of weighted exposures based on coefficients 
      from each model, were calculated in the validation dataset. In addition, we 
      estimated ES based on meta-analyses and a simple sum score of exposures. Accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic, and 
      Nagelkerke's R2 were compared. The ESMeta-analyses performed the worst, whereas the 
      sum score and the ESGNB were worse than the ESLR that performed similar to the 
      ESLASSO and ESRIDGE. The ESLR distinguished patients from controls (odds ratio [OR] 
      = 1.94, P < .001), patients from siblings (OR = 1.58, P < .001), and siblings from 
      controls (OR = 1.21, P = .001). An increase in ESLR was associated with a gradient 
      increase of schizophrenia risk. In reference to the remaining fractions, the ESLR at 
      top 30%, 20%, and 10% of the control distribution yielded ORs of 3.72, 3.74, and 
      4.77, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that predictive modeling approaches can 
      be harnessed to evaluate the exposome.

AB  - This manuscript introduces Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) and its potential in 
      the assessment of diverse aspects related to public health. This methodology can 
      provide data in a relatively short temporal and local scale (typically dialy-weekly 
      at the municipal level) on consumption patterns of illicit drugs (e.g. cocaine or 
      cannabis), licit substances of abuse (e.g. alcohol) by measuring their consumption 
      biomarkers (i.e. the original unmetabolized substance or some of its metabolite) in 
      wastewater. Besides discussing the fundaments, advantages and shortcomings of WBE, 
      it reviews some of the main precedents at international level and most remarkable 
      activities that have been taken place in this field in Spain. Finally, the Spanish 
      Network of Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (ESAR-Net) as is presented. ESAR-Net is an 
      Excellence Network that sums up the efforts of the most relevant Spanish researchers 
      in the field of WBE, aiming to investigate future perspectives of this methodology 
      and its impact on Public Health competences in Spain.

TI  - Substance use and suicidal ideation and behaviour in low- and middle-income 
      countries: a systematic review.

LID - 549
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding relationships between substance use and suicidal ideation 
      and behaviour (SIB) has important public health implications for suicide prevention 
      in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 75% of suicides occur. This 
      systematic review explored the associations between substance use and SIB in LMICs. 
      METHODS: We searched five databases using a combination of keywords for substance 
      use, SIB and LMICs to identify English-written quantitative studies published 
      between January 2006 and February 2016. Data were extracted to provide an overview 
      of what is known about the topic, highlight gaps in the literature, and explore the 
      implications of current knowledge for suicide prevention. Studies included in the 
      review were assessed for methodological quality using the Scottish Intercollegiate 
      Guidelines Network checklist. RESULTS: Analysis of included studies (N = 108) 
      demonstrated a consistent positive association between substance use and SIB across 
      all substances (i.e. alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, illicit drugs, non-medical use of 
      prescription drugs), all substance use dimensions (i.e. intoxication, use, and 
      pathological use) and all SIB dimensions (i.e. suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal 
      behaviour, and suicide). Most of the available research evidence comes from 
      upper-middle-income countries, only 22% comes from lower-middle-income and 
      low-income countries. Most studies focused on alcohol and tobacco, while neglecting 
      substances such as cannabis, opioids, sedatives, stimulants, misuse of prescription 
      medication, inhalants, and hallucinogens. Most of the studies employed a 
      cross-sectional design, were conducted within a risk-factor paradigm, and provided 
      little information about the potential interaction between variables. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Public health suicide prevention policy and research in LMICs should take account of 
      the fact that: substance use is a potentially modifiable risk factor; assessment and 
      management of substance use is integral to the care of at-risk patients; reducing 
      consumption and hazardous use of substances in LMICs is important for suicide 
      prevention; and research needs to be expanded to include more theory driven research 
      that focuses on all substance use dimensions and SIB dimensions, while employing 
      more sophisticated statistical methods.

TI  - Chronic Cannabidiol Administration Attenuates Skeletal Muscle De Novo Ceramide 
      Synthesis Pathway and Related Metabolic Effects in a Rat Model of High-Fat 
      Diet-Induced Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/biom10091241 [doi]
LID - 1241
AB  - Numerous studies showed that sustained obesity results in accumulation of bioactive 
      lipid derivatives in several tissues, including skeletal muscle, which further 
      contributes to the development of metabolic disturbances and insulin resistance 
      (IR). The latest data indicate that a potential factor regulating lipid and glucose 
      metabolism is a phytocannabinoid-cannabidiol (CBD), a component of medical marijuana 
      (Cannabis). Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether chronic CBD administration 
      influences bioactive lipid content (e.g., ceramide (CER)), as well as glucose 
      metabolism, in the red skeletal muscle (musculus gastrocnemius) with predominant 
      oxidative metabolism. All experiments were conducted on an animal model of obesity, 
      i.e., Wistar rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or standard rodent chow, and 
      subsequently injected with CBD in a dose of 10 mg/kg or its solvent for two weeks. 
      The sphingolipid content was assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC), while, in order to determine insulin and glucose concentrations, 
      immunoenzymatic and colorimetric methods were used. The protein expression from 
      sphingolipid and insulin signaling pathways, as well as endocannabinoidome 
      components, was evaluated by immunoblotting. Unexpectedly, our experimental model 
      revealed that the significantly intensified intramuscular de novo CER synthesis 
      pathway in the HFD group was attenuated by chronic CBD treatment. Additionally, due 
      to CBD administration, the content of other sphingolipid derivatives, i.e., 
      sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was restored in the high-fat feeding state, which 
      coincided with an improvement in skeletal muscle insulin signal transduction and 
      glycogen recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary analysis using data from the National Drug Abuse Treatment 
      Clinical Trials Network randomized trial (NCT # 01207791), in which 1285 adult ED 
      patients endorsing moderate to severe problems related to drug use were recruited 
      from 6 US academic hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of hair analysis 
      in drug use disorder trials with infrequent visits, and its concordance with 
      Timeline Follow Back (TLFB). METHODS: This study compared the self-reported drug use 
      on the TLFB instrument with the biological measure of drug use from hair analysis 
      for four major drug classes (Cannabis, Cocaine, Prescribed Opioids and Street 
      Opioids). Both hair analysis and TLFB were conducted at 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up 
      visit and each covered a 90-day recall period prior to the visit. RESULTS: The 
      concordance between the hair sample results and the TLFB was high for cannabis and 
      street opioids, but was low to moderate for cocaine and prescribed opioids. 
      Under-reporting of drug use given the positive hair sample was always significantly 
      lower for the drug the study participant noted as their primary drug of choice 
      compared with other drugs the participant reported taking, irrespective of whether 
      the drug of choice was cannabis, cocaine, street opioids and prescribed opioids. 
      Over-reporting of drug use given the negative hair sample was always significantly 
      higher for the drug of choice, except for cocaine. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends 
      the literature on hair analysis supporting its use as a secondary outcome measure in 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Medical complications associated with substance use disorders in patients with type 
      2 diabetes and hypertension: electronic health record findings.
PG  - 1462-1470
LID - 10.1111/add.14607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Screening for substance use disorder (SUD) in general medical 
      settings may be particularly important in patients with comorbid health conditions 
      exacerbated by SUD. This study evaluated whether SUD is associated with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications in patients with co-occurring T2DM and 
      hypertension. DESIGN: Analysis of a limited data set obtained through IBM Watson 
      Health Explorys, a platform integrating data from electronic health records. Matched 
      controls were defined for each of five SUDs: tobacco use disorder (TUD), opioid use 
      disorder (OUD), cocaine use disorder, cannabis use disorder (CUD) and alcohol use 
      disorder (AUD) using Mahalanobis distance within propensity score calipers. SETTING: 
      All patients were seen in the MetroHealth System (Cleveland, OH, USA) and had 
      diagnosis codes for T2DM and hypertension. PARTICIPANTS: SUD group participants had 
      a diagnosis of abuse/dependence for the substance of interest. Controls for each SUD 
      group had no diagnosis code related to the SUD of interest and were selected to 
      match the SUD patients on demographics, residential zip code median income and body 
      mass index. Total sample sizes for each SUD-control comparison ranged from 1160 for 
      CUD to 22 128 for TUD. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome was diagnosis (yes/no) of four T2DM 
      complications (cerebrovascular accident, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic renal 
      disease, myocardial infarction) and all-cause mortality. FINDINGS: Logistic 
      regressions revealed that SUD was significantly associated with greater risk of 
      cerebrovascular accident [TUD odds ratio (OR) = 1.79, OUD-OR = 1.94, cocaine use 
      disorder OR = 2.67], diabetic neuropathy [TUD-adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.47, cocaine use 
      disorder-aOR = 1.35, AUD-aOR = 1.27], diabetic renal disease (TUD-aOR = 1.25, 
      OUD-OR = 1.34), myocardial infarction (TUD-OR = 1.96, OUD-OR = 2.01, cocaine use 
      disorder-OR = 2.68, CUD-OR = 2.48, AUD-OR = 1.42) and mortality (TUD-OR = 1.15, 
      cocaine use disorder-OR = 1.61, CUD-OR = 1.49, AUD-OR = 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Among 
      patients in Ohio USA with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension, 
      those with substance use disorders appear to have greater risk for T2DM 
      complications and all-cause mortality.

LID - 8973515
AB  - Ontario has shown an increasing number of emergency department (ED) visits, 
      particularly for mental health and addiction (MHA) complaints. Given the current 
      opioid crises Canada is facing and the legalization of recreational cannabis in 
      October 2018, the number of MHA visits to the ED is expected to grow even further. 
      In face of these events, we examine capacity planning alternatives for the ED of an 
      academic hospital in Toronto. We first quantify the volume of ED visits the hospital 
      has received in recent years (from 2012 to 2016) and use forecasting techniques to 
      predict future ED demand for the hospital. We then employ a discrete-event 
      simulation model to analyze the impacts of the following scenarios: (a) increasing 
      overall demand to the ED, (b) increasing or decreasing number of ED visits due to 
      substance abuse, and (c) adjusting resource capacity to address the forecasted 
      demand. Key performance indicators used in this analysis are the overall ED length 
      of stay (LOS) and the total number of patients treated in the Psychiatric Emergency 
      Services Unit (PESU) as a percentage of the total number of MHA visits. Our results 
      showed that if resource capacity is not adjusted, ED LOS will deteriorate 
      considerably given the expected growth in demand; programs that aim to reduce the 
      number of alcohol and/or opioid visits can greatly aid in reducing ED wait times; 
      the legalization of recreational use of cannabis will have minimal impact, and 
      increasing the number of PESU beds can provide great aid in reducing ED pressure.

AB  - The health benefits of the Aquilaria crassna Pierre ex Lecomte leaf extract (AE) 
      make it very useful as an ingredient in food and pharmaceutical products. 
      Iriflophenone 3,5-C-β-d-diglucoside (1), iriflophenone 3-C-β-d-glucoside (2) and 
      mangiferin (3) are bioactive compounds of AE. We assessed the stability of AE by 
      investigating the thermal degradation kinetics and shelf-life (t(90%)) of compounds 
      1, 2 and 3 using Arrhenius plot models and studied their pH-rate profiles. The 
      results demonstrate that 1 and 2 were degraded, following a first-order kinetic 
      reaction. The degradation of 3 followed first-order reaction kinetics when present 
      in a solution and second-order reaction kinetics in the dried powder form of the 
      extract. According to the first-order kinetic model, the predicted shelf-life 
      (t(90%)) of the extract at 25 °C in dried form for compound 1 was 989 days with 
      activation energy 129.86 kJ·mol(-1), and for 2 it was 248 days with activation 
      energy 110.57 kJ·mol(-1), while in the extract solution, the predicted shelf-life of 
      compounds 1-3 was 189, 13 and 75 days with activation energies 86.83, 51.49 and 
      65.28 kJ·mol(-1), respectively. In addition, the pH-rate profiles of 1-3 indicated 
      that they were stable in neutral to acidic environments.

TI  - Individual opioids, and long- versus short-acting opioids, for chronic noncancer 
      pain: Protocol for a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - e17647
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000017647 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioids are frequently prescribed for the management of patients with 
      chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Previous meta-analyses of efficacy and harms have 
      combined treatment effects across all opioids; however, specific opioids, 
      pharmacokinetic properties (ie, long acting vs short acting), or the type of 
      formulation (ie, immediate vs extended release) may be a source of heterogeneity for 
      pooled effects. METHODS: We will conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized 
      controlled trials evaluating opioids for CNCP. We will acquire eligible studies 
      through systematic searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, and the 
      Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Eligible studies will have 
      randomly allocated adult CNCP patients to an oral or transdermal opioid versus 
      another type of opioid (or formulation) or placebo, and follow patients for ≥ 4 
      weeks. We will collect outcome data for pain intensity, physical function, nausea, 
      vomiting, and constipation. Pairs of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, 
      abstract data from eligible trials and assess risk of bias using a modified Cochrane 
      tool. We will assess coherence of our networks through both a global test, and by 
      comparing direct and indirect evidence for each comparison with node-splitting. 
      RESULTS: Using a frequentist approach, we will conduct random effects multiple 
      treatment meta-analysis to establish treatment effects of individual opioids for 
      each outcome. The certainty of evidence for pooled treatment effects will be 
      assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We will categorize interventions from most to least 
      effective based on the effect estimates obtained from NMAs and their associated 
      certainty of evidence, as follows: superior to both placebo and alternatives; 
      superior to placebo, but inferior to alternatives; and no better than placebo. 
      CONCLUSION: This NMA will determine the relative effectiveness and adverse effects 
      of individual opioids among patients with CNCP. Our results will help inform the 
      appropriateness of assuming similar beneficial and adverse effects of varying opioid 
      formulations. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: This systematic review is registered

TI  - Psychosis associated with acute recreational drug toxicity: a European case series.
PG  - 293
LID - 10.1186/s12888-016-1002-7 [doi]
LID - 293
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosis can be associated with acute recreational drug and novel 
      psychoactive substance (NPS) toxicity. However, there is limited data available on 
      how common this is and which drugs are most frequently implicated. We describe a 
      European case series of psychosis associated with acute recreational drug toxicity, 
      and estimate the frequency of psychosis for different recreational drugs. METHODS: 
      The European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) collects data on presentations to 
      Emergency Departments (EDs) with acute recreational drug and NPS toxicity at 16 
      centres in ten countries. Euro-DEN data from October 2013 through September 2014 was 
      retrospectively searched, and cases with psychosis were included. The proportion of 
      cases with psychosis per drug was calculated in the searched Euro-DEN dataset. 
      RESULTS: Psychosis was present in 348 (6.3 %) of 5529 cases. The median 
      (interquartile range) age was 29 (24-38) years, 276 (79.3 %) were male and 114 (32.8 
      %) were admitted to psychiatric ward. The drugs most commonly reported were cannabis 
      in 90 (25.9 %) cases, amphetamine in 87 (25.0 %) and cocaine in 56 (16.1 %). More 
      than one drug was taken in 189 (54.3 %) cases. Psychosis was frequent in those ED 
      presentations involving tryptamines (4/7; 57.1 %), methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) 
      (6/22; 27.3 %), methylphenidate (6/26; 23.1 %), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) 
      (18/86; 20.9 %), psilocybe mushrooms (3/16; 18.8 %), synthetic cannabinoid receptor 
      agonists (4/26; 15.4 %) and amphetamine (87/593; 14.7 %), but less common in those 
      involving mephedrone (14/245; 5.7 %), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (20/461; 
      4.3 %) and methedrone (3/92; 3.3 %). Amphetamine was the most frequent drug 
      associated with psychosis when only one agent was reported, with psychosis occurring 
      in 32.4 % of these presentations. CONCLUSION: The frequency of psychosis in acute 
      recreational drug toxicity varies considerably between drugs, but is a major problem 
      in amphetamine poisoning. In rapidly changing drug markets and patterns of use, the 
      Euro-DEN sentinel network contributes to measuring the scale of drug-related harms 
      in Europe beyond other more established indicators.

TI  - Adverse childhood events and psychosis in bipolar affective disorder.
PG  - 191-7
LID - 10.1192/bjp.bp.114.152611 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing interest in the association between childhood 
      trauma and psychosis. Proposals for potential mechanisms involved include affective 
      dysregulation and cognitive appraisals of threat. AIMS: To establish if, within 
      bipolar disorder, childhood events show a significant association with psychosis, 
      and in particular with symptoms driven by dysregulation of mood or with a 
      persecutory content. METHOD: Data on lifetime-ever presence of psychotic symptoms 
      were determined by detailed structured interview with case-note review (n = 2019). 
      Childhood events were recorded using a self-report questionnaire and case-note 
      information. RESULTS: There was no relationship between childhood events, or 
      childhood abuse, and psychosis per se. Childhood events were not associated with an 
      increased risk of persecutory or other delusions. Significant associations were 
      found between childhood abuse and auditory hallucinations, strongest between sexual 
      abuse and mood congruent or abusive voices. These relationships remain significant 
      even after controlling for lifetime-ever cannabis misuse. CONCLUSIONS: Within 
      affective disorder, the relationship between childhood events and psychosis appears 
      to be relatively symptom-specific. It is possible that the pathways leading to 
      psychotic symptoms differ, with delusions and non-hallucinatory symptoms being 
      influenced less by childhood or early environmental experience.

AB  - Background and Aims: COVID-19 has infected more than 77 million people worldwide and 
      impacted the lives of many more, with a particularly devastating impact on 
      vulnerable populations, including people with substance use disorders (SUDs). 
      Quarantines, travel bans, regulatory changes, social distancing, and "lockdown" 
      measures have affected drug and alcohol supply chains and subsequently their 
      availability, price, and use patterns, with possible downstream effects on 
      presentations of SUDs and demand for treatment. Given the lack of multicentric 
      epidemiologic studies, we conducted a rapid global survey within the International 
      Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) network in order to understand the status of 
      substance-use patterns during the current pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional survey. 
      Setting: Worldwide. Participants: Starting on April 4, 2020 during a 5-week period, 
      the survey received 185 responses from 77 countries. Measurements: To assess 
      addiction medicine professionals' perceived changes in drug and alcohol supply, 
      price, use pattern, and related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Findings: Participants reported (among who answered "decreased" or "increased") a 
      decrease in drug supply (69.0%) and at the same time an increase in price (95.3%) 
      globally. With respect to changes in use patterns, an increase in alcohol (71.7%), 
      cannabis (63.0%), prescription opioids (70.9%), and sedative/hypnotics (84.6%) use 
      was reported, while the use of amphetamines (59.7%), cocaine (67.5%), and opiates 
      (58.2%) was reported to decrease overall. Conclusions: The global report on changes 
      in the availability, use patterns, and complications of alcohol and drugs during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic should be considered in making new policies and in developing 
      mitigating measures and guidelines during the current pandemic (and probable future 
      ones) in order to minimize risks to people with SUD.

TI  - A Self-Reported Version of the Measurements in the Addictions for Triage and 
      Evaluation-Q: Concurrent Validity with the MATE 2.1.
PG  - 20-27
LID - 10.1159/000503625 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Substance abuse treatment centers require reliable and valid 
      instruments to monitor treatment progress, to evaluate treatment effectiveness, and 
      to initiate clinical trials. Currently the Measurements in the Addictions for Triage 
      and Evaluation (MATE) 2.1, an instrument that serves these purposes, is considered 
      quite lengthy and intensive, especially in the case of allocation to milder 
      treatment intensity. Therefore, a self-reported version of the MATE-Q was designed 
      for patients with mild to moderate substance-abuse and co-occurring problems. The 
      aim of the present study was to assess concurrent validity with the interviewer 
      version of the MATE (version 2.1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected at 2 
      locations of a Dutch substance abuse treatment center, one location in a large city 
      and one in a suburban area. A correlational design was employed, where each included 
      participant completed a MATE-Q and a MATE 2.1 within 3 days or less (administered at 
      intake, before treatment initiation). A total of 98 treatment-seeking patients were 
      included (51.0% alcohol as a primary problem, 19.4% cannabis, 14.3% gambling and 
      6.1% cocaine). Measurements included the MATE-Q and the MATE 2.1. Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICCs) for single measures were calculated, deploying the 
      2-way mixed procedure with absolute agreement. Descriptives of scores comprise means 
      and Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. RESULTS: For the majority (15 out of 
      24) of the scores ICCs were equal or above 0.7. For 93 patients (95%), the primary 
      problem substance or problem behavior was reported correspondingly. Nine MATE-Q mean 
      scores differed significantly from their MATE 2.1 counterparts. 
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: For the majority of scores, the MATE-Q has acceptable 
      concurrent validity for the assessment of patients with mild to moderate substance 
      abuse and co-occurring problems.

TI  - Canadian Association of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline for the Medical 
      Management of Pediatric Luminal Crohn's Disease.
PG  - e35-e63
LID - 10.1093/jcag/gwz018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We aim to provide guidance for medical treatment of luminal 
      Crohn's disease in children. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of 
      publication databases to identify studies of medical management of pediatric Crohn's 
      disease. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to 
      the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) 
      approach. We developed statements through an iterative online platform and then 
      finalized and voted on them. RESULTS: The consensus includes 25 statements focused 
      on medical treatment options. Consensus was not reached, and no recommendations were 
      made, for 14 additional statements, largely due to lack of evidence. The group 
      suggested corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide for mild to moderate 
      disease). The group suggested exclusive enteral nutrition for induction therapy and 
      biologic tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction and maintenance therapy at 
      diagnosis or at early stages of severe disease, and for patients failed by steroid 
      and immunosuppressant induction therapies. The group recommended against the use of 
      oral 5-aminosalicylate for induction or maintenance therapy in patients with 
      moderate disease, and recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy, 
      corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, and cannabis in any role. The group was 
      unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressants during 
      initiation therapy with a biologic agent, although thiopurine combinations are not 
      recommended for male patients. No consensus was reached on the role of 
      aminosalicylates in treatment of patients with mild disease, antibiotics or 
      vedolizumab for induction or maintenance therapy, or methotrexate for induction 
      therapy. Patients in clinical remission who are receiving immunomodulators should be 
      assessed for mucosal healing within 1 year of treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Evidence-based medical treatment of Crohn's disease in children is recommended, with 
      thorough ongoing assessments to define treatment success.

TI  - DNA methylation and substance-use risk: a prospective, genome-wide study spanning 
      gestation to adolescence.
PG  - e976
LID - 10.1038/tp.2016.247 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic processes have been implicated in addiction; yet, it remains unclear 
      whether these represent a risk factor and/or a consequence of substance use. Here, 
      we believe we conducted the first genome-wide, longitudinal study to investigate 
      whether DNA methylation patterns in early life prospectively associate with 
      substance use in adolescence. The sample comprised of 244 youth (51% female) from 
      the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), with repeated 
      assessments of DNA methylation (Illumina 450k array; cord blood at birth, whole 
      blood at age 7) and substance use (tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use; age 14-18). We 
      found that, at birth, epigenetic variation across a tightly interconnected genetic 
      network (n=65 loci; q<0.05) associated with greater levels of substance use during 
      adolescence, as well as an earlier age of onset amongst users. Associations were 
      specific to the neonatal period and not observed at age 7. Key annotated genes 
      included PACSIN1, NEUROD4 and NTRK2, implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. 
      Several of the identified loci were associated with known methylation quantitative 
      trait loci, and consequently likely to be under significant genetic control. 
      Collectively, these 65 loci were also found to partially mediate the effect of 
      prenatal maternal tobacco smoking on adolescent substance use. Together, findings 
      lend novel insights into epigenetic correlates of substance use, highlight birth as 
      a potentially sensitive window of biological vulnerability and provide preliminary 
      evidence of an indirect epigenetic pathway linking prenatal tobacco exposure and 
      adolescent substance use.

TI  - General practice patients starting treatment for substance use problems: 
      observations from two data sources across levels of care.
PG  - 960
LID - 10.1186/s12889-020-09038-0 [doi]
LID - 960
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Belgium, the incidence of treatment episodes for substance use 
      problems is monitored by the Network of Sentinel General Practices (SGP), and at 
      higher, specialist care levels by the Treatment Demand Indicator (TDI) surveillance. 
      Using both data sources, we examine 1) how patients starting specialist treatment 
      for substance use problems on referral by their GP compare to those that were 
      referred by non-GP caregivers; 2) how patients starting GP treatment for substance 
      use problems without receiving concurrent specialist treatment compare to those who 
      did. METHODS: Both surveillances are based on the TDI protocol for reporting data to 
      the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) on individuals 
      starting treatment as a result of their substance use. Data from 2016 and 2017 were 
      examined using 95% confidence intervals and multivariate logistic regression. 
      RESULTS: According to TDI-data (n = 16,543), determinants of being referred by a GP 
      (versus by a non-GP caregiver) for specialist treatment were age ≥ median (OR 1.25; 
      95% CI 1.13-1.38), education ≥ secondary level (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.15-1.41), recent 
      employment (OR 1.71; 1.56-1.88), recent stable accommodation (3.62; 95% CI 
      3.08-4.26), first treatment episode (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.57-1.87), recent daily 
      primary substance use (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.33-1.59) and mono substance use (OR 1.23; 
      95% CI 1.04-1.48). Type of substance use was a significant determinant with higher 
      odds of using pharmaceuticals (and alcohol) (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.04-1.48), and lower 
      odds of using cannabis only/primarily (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62-0.86), with reference to 
      street drugs minus cannabis only/primarily. According to SGP data (n = 314), 
      determinants of starting GP treatment without concurrent specialist treatment were 
      recent employment (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.36-4.91), first treatment episode (OR 2.78; 95% 
      CI 1.39-5.55) and living in the Brussels or Walloon region (OR 1.97; 95% CI 
      1.06-3.66). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a useful insight into the general 
      practice population treated for substance use problems. It shows that both 
      surveillances consistently found a relatively favourable profile of general practice 
      patients with substance use problems.

TI  - "I feel like I've hit the bottom and have no idea what to do": Supportive social 
      networking on Reddit for individuals with a desire to quit cannabis use.
PG  - 477-482
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2017.1354956 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Online communities can provide social support to those in need and can 
      foster personal empowerment for individuals experiencing distress. This study 
      examines the content of a Reddit community dedicated to the support of people trying 
      to quit using cannabis, in order to develop an understanding of the type of social 
      networking occurring on this subreddit (e.g., community). METHODS: A total of 100 
      Reddit posts and their replies (i.e., comments) were collected from the subreddit on 
      June 12, 2015. Posts were qualitatively coded for expression of DSM-5 (Diagnostic 
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) symptoms of cannabis use 
      disorder (CUD) as well as other prominently featured themes. Comments on posts where 
      individuals were seeking support/advice were also coded. RESULTS: Ninety-one people 
      posted the 100 Reddit posts, and of those 35 (38%) people described enough symptoms 
      to be classified as mild disorder severity, 15 (16%) moderate, and 11 (12%) severe, 
      as outlined in the diagnostic criteria for CUD. Over half of posts (n = 51) were 
      seeking advice and/or support from members of the community. There were 174 comments 
      made by 108 unique people on the advice/support seeking posts. Most were 
      supportive/encouraging in nature (140, 80%) and gave advice to the post author (126, 
      72%). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory research highlights the potential of online 
      communities as tools for individuals coping with addiction recovery, and future 
      research should investigate if involvement in such communities would be a beneficial 
      supplement to more traditional recovery practices.

AB  - Cannabis continues to be the most accessible and popular illicit recreational drug. 
      Whereas current data link adolescence cannabinoid exposure to increased risk for 
      dependence on other drugs, depression, anxiety disorders and psychosis, the 
      mechanism(s) underlying these adverse effects remains controversial. Here we show in 
      a mouse model of female adolescent cannabinoid exposure deficient endocannabinoid 
      (eCB)-mediated signaling and presynaptic forms of long-term depression at adult 
      central glutamatergic synapses in the prefrontal cortex. Increasing endocannabinoid 
      levels by blockade of monoacylglycerol lipase, the primary enzyme responsible for 
      degrading the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), with the specific 
      inhibitor JZL 184 ameliorates eCB-LTD deficits. The observed deficit in cortical 
      presynaptic signaling may represent a neural maladaptation underlying network 
      instability and abnormal cognitive functioning. Our study suggests that adolescent 
      cannabinoid exposure may permanently impair brain functions, including the brain's 
      intrinsic ability to appropriately adapt to external influences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and substance use may 
      have an earlier onset of illness compared to those without substance use. Most 
      previous studies have, however, too small samples to control for confounding 
      variables and the effect of specific types of substances. The present study aimed to 
      examine the relationship between substance use and age at onset, in addition to the 
      influence of possible confounders and specific substances, in a large and 
      heterogeneous multisite sample of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. 
      METHODS: The patients (N=1119) were recruited from catchment areas in Oslo, 
      Stavanger and Bergen, Norway, diagnosed according to DSM-IV and screened for 
      substance use history. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the 
      relationship between substance use and age at onset of illness. RESULTS: Patients 
      with substance use (n=627) had about 3years earlier age at onset (23.0years; SD 7.1) 
      than the abstinent group (n=492; 25.9years; SD 9.7). Only cannabis use was 
      statistically significantly related to earlier age at onset. Gender or family 
      history of psychosis did not influence the results. CONCLUSION: Cannabis use is 
      associated with 3years earlier onset of psychosis.

TI  - DSM-5 in patients seeking their first treatment for alcohol use disorder. Sex 
      differences in the multicenter CohRTA study.
PG  - 136-144
LID - 10.20882/adicciones.1177 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze sex differences in the DSM-5 criteria among patients 
      admitted to  their first treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). METHODS: 
      Assessment of AUD was carried out using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in a multicenter 
      study (CohRTA) within the Spanish Network on Addictive Disorders. Further, baseline 
      questionnaires including socio-demographics, family history, lifetime alcohol 
      consumption and other substance use, as well as clinical and laboratory parameters 
      were obtained during admission. RESULTS: 313 patients (74.8%M) were eligible; mean 
      age at first AUD treatment was 48.8 years (standard deviation (SD): 9.9 years). Age 
      at onset of alcohol use was 15.9 years (SD: 3.3 years) and age at starting regular 
      alcohol consumption was 25.6 years (SD: 9.6 years). Almost 69.3% of patients were 
      tobacco smokers and 61% had family history of AUD. Regarding other substance use, 
      7.7% were current cocaine users and 18.2% were cannabis users. Women started regular 
      alcohol consumption later than men (p<,001) and used benzodiazepines more frequently 
      (p=.013). According to DSM-5, 89.5% of cases had severe AUD (≥6 criteria). In the 
      adjusted analysis (logistic regression), men were more likely to neglect major rules 
      (OR=1.92, 95%CI: 1.06-3.48) and to have hazardous alcohol use (OR=3.00, 95%CI: 
      1.65-5.46). DISCUSSION: DSM-5 detects sex differences in patients seeking their 
      first AUD treatment. Social impairment and risky alcohol use are significantly more 
      frequent in men.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of illegal drug use in college students on any 
      previous occasion, during the previous year and the previous month, and to analyze 
      the relationship between illegal drug use and family support and other factors. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study using data from students participating in the 
      uniHcos project (n = 3767) was conducted. The prevalence and age of onset of 
      consumption of cannabis, non-prescription sedatives, stimulants and depressants was 
      evaluated. Polyconsumption was also assessed. The independent variables were: family 
      support, age, residence, and employment status. To determine the factors related to 
      drug use multivariate logistic regression models stratified by gender were fitted. 
      RESULTS: Differences between men and women in prevalence of illegal drug use except 
      non-prescription sedatives were observed. In both genders, less family support was 
      associated with higher consumption of all drugs, except depressants, and with 
      polyconsumption. To be studying and looking for work was related to cannabis and 
      stimulant use and to polyconsumption among women, but only to cannabis use among 
      men. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the notion that the start of university 
      studies is a particularly relevant stage in the onset of illegal drug use and its 
      prevention, and that consumption may be especially associated with family support.

TI  - Short-Term Efficacy of CBD-Enriched Hemp Oil in Girls with Dysautonomic Syndrome 
      after Human Papillomavirus Vaccination.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD)-based treatments for several diseases, including 
      Tourette's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, movement disorders and glaucoma, 
      are proving to be beneficial and the scientific clinical background of the drug is 
      continuously evolving. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the short-term effect of 
      CBD-enriched hemp oil for relieving symptoms and improving the life quality (QOL) in 
      young girls with adverse drug effects (ADRs) following human papillomavirus (HPV) 
      vaccine. METHODS: In this anecdotal, retrospective, "compassionate-use", 
      observational, open-label study, 12 females (age 12-24 years) with severe somatoform 
      and dysautonomic syndrome following HPV vaccination were given sublingual CBD-rich 
      hemp oil drops, 25 mg/kg per day supplemented by 2-5 mg/ml CBD once a week until a 
      maximum dose of 150 mg/ml CBD per day was reached over a 3 month period. Patients' 
      quality of life was evaluated using the medical outcome short-form health survey 
      questionnaire (SF-36). RESULTS: Two patients dropped out due to iatrogenic adverse 
      events and another two patients stopped the treatment early due to lack of any 
      improvement. SF-36 showed significant benefits in the physical component score (P < 
      0.02), vitality (P < 0.03) and social role functioning (P < 0.02) after the 
      treatment. The administration of hemp oil also significantly reduced body pain 
      according to the SF-36 assessment. No significant differences from the start of 
      treatment to several months post-treatment were detected in role limitations due to 
      emotional reactions (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the safety and 
      tolerability of CBD-rich hemp oil and the primary efficacy endpoint. Randomized 
      controlled trials are warranted to characterize the safety profile and efficacy of 
      this compound.

TI  - The Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Internet Use and Associations With 
      Psychopathology: A Twin Study.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1017/thg.2015.91 [doi]
AB  - Excessive internet use has been linked to psychopathology. Therefore, understanding 
      the genetic and environmental risks underpinning internet use and their relation to 
      psychopathology is important. This study aims to explore the genetic and 
      environmental etiology of internet use measures and their associations with 
      internalizing disorders and substance use disorders. The sample included 2,059 
      monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) young adult twins from the Brisbane Longitudinal 
      Twin Study (BLTS). Younger participants reported more frequent internet use, while 
      women were more likely to use the internet for interpersonal communication. Familial 
      aggregation in 'frequency of internet use' was entirely explained by additive 
      genetic factors accounting for 41% of the variance. Familial aggregation in 
      'frequency of use after 11 pm', 'using the internet to contact peers', and 'using 
      the internet primarily to access social networking sites' was attributable to 
      varying combinations of additive genetic and shared environmental factors. In terms 
      of psychopathology, there were no significant associations between internet use 
      measures and major depression (MD), but there were positive significant associations 
      between 'frequency of internet use' and 'frequency of use after 11 pm' with social 
      phobia (SP). 'Using the internet to contact peers' was positively associated with 
      alcohol abuse, whereas 'using the internet to contact peers' and 'using the internet 
      primarily to access social networking sites' were negatively associated with 
      cannabis use disorders and nicotine symptoms. Individual differences in internet use 
      can be attributable to varying degrees of genetic and environmental risks. Despite 
      some significant associations of small effect, variation in internet use appears 
      mostly unrelated to psychopathology.

TI  - Predictors and Profiles of Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence Among African American 
      Adolescents and Young Adult Males Living with HIV.
PG  - 324-38
LID - 10.1089/apc.2015.0351 [doi]
AB  - Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for thwarting HIV disease 
      progression and reducing secondary HIV transmission, yet youth living with HIV (YLH) 
      struggle with adherence. The highest rates of new HIV infections in the United 
      States occur in young African American men. A sample of 387 HIV-positive young 
      African American males on ART was selected from a cross-sectional assessment of 
      (YLH) receiving medical care within the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS 
      Interventions (ATN) from 2010 to 2012 (12-24 years old, median 22.00, SD 2.08). 
      Participants completed self-reported adherence, demographic, health, and 
      psychosocial measures. Sixty-two percent self-reported 100% ART adherence. Optimal 
      data analysis identified frequency of cannabis use during the past 3 months as the 
      strongest independent predictor of adherence, yielding moderate effect strength 
      sensitivity (ESS) = 27.1, p < 0.001. Among participants with infrequent cannabis 
      use, 72% reported full adherence; in contrast, only 45% of participants who used 
      cannabis frequently reported full adherence. Classification tree analysis (CTA) was 
      utilized to improve classification accuracy and to identify the pathways of ART 
      adherence and nonadherence. The CTA model evidenced a 38% improvement above chance 
      for correctly classifying participants as ART adherent or nonadherent. Participants 
      most likely to be adherent were those with low psychological distress and minimal 
      alcohol use (82% were adherent). Participants least likely to be adherent were those 
      with higher psychological distress and engaged in weekly cannabis use (69% were 
      nonadherent). Findings suggest multiple profiles of ART adherence for young African 
      American males living with HIV and argue for targeted psychosocial interventions.

TI  - Methylation patterns in whole blood correlate with symptoms in schizophrenia 
      patients.
PG  - 769-76
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbt080 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation, one of the main epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression, 
      appears to be involved in the development of schizophrenia (SZ). In this study, we 
      investigated 7562 DNA methylation markers in blood from 98 SZ patients and 108 
      healthy controls. A linear regression model including age, gender, race, alcohol, 
      nicotine and cannabis use status, and diagnosis was implemented to identify 
      C-phosphate-G (CpG) sites significantly associated with diagnosis. These CpG sites 
      were further validated using an independent data set. Sixteen CpG sites were 
      identified with hyper- or hypomethylation in patients. A further verification of 
      expression of the corresponding genes identified 7 genes whose expression levels 
      were also significantly altered in patients. While such altered methylation patterns 
      showed no correlation with disorganized symptoms and negative symptoms in patients, 
      11 CpG sites significantly correlated with reality distortion symptoms. The 
      direction of the correlations indicates that methylation changes possibly play a 
      protective mechanism to lessen delusion and hallucination symptoms in patients. 
      Pathway analyses showed that the most significant biological function of the 
      differentially methylated CpGs is inflammatory response with CD224, LAX1, TXK, PRF1, 
      CD7, MPG, and MPO genes directly involved in activations of T cells, B cells, and 
      natural killer cells or in cytotoxic reaction. Our results suggest that such 
      methylation changes may modulate aspects of the immune response and hence protect 
      against the neurobiological substrate of reality distortion symptoms in SZ patients.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test an integrated cognitive behavioral and 
      contingency management (CBT/CM) intervention for young people living with HIV (YPLH) 
      with an alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder in an open pilot trial. Seventeen 
      participants (ages 18-24) were recruited from three HIV community clinics. 
      Assessments were completed at pre-and post-treatment as well as 3 month follow-up. 
      Eighty percent of participants were retained in the study. Results suggest that the 
      CBT/CM intervention was acceptable, feasible, and could be delivered with fidelity. 
      Further, participants reported significant reductions in alcohol use, withdrawal 
      symptoms, dependence symptoms and related problems, as well as co-occurring 
      depressive symptoms and delinquent behavior across assessment periods. A trend was 
      evident for reductions in marijuana use and related problems. Overall, these 
      preliminary results suggest that a substance abuse CBT/CM intervention tailored to 
      YPLH is acceptable, feasible, and holds promise for symptomatic improvement. Further 
      testing of this type of protocol is warranted.

AB  - Cannabis use is associated with psychosis, particularly in those with expression of, 
      or vulnerability for, psychotic illness. The biological underpinnings of these 
      differential associations, however, remain largely unknown. We used Positron 
      Emission Tomography and (18)F-fallypride to test the hypothesis that genetic risk 
      for psychosis is expressed by differential induction of dopamine release by Δ(9)-THC 
      (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis). In a 
      single dynamic PET scanning session, striatal dopamine release after pulmonary 
      administration of Δ(9)-THC was measured in 9 healthy cannabis users (average risk 
      psychotic disorder), 8 patients with psychotic disorder (high risk psychotic 
      disorder) and 7 un-related first-degree relatives (intermediate risk psychotic 
      disorder). PET data were analyzed applying the linear extension of the simplified 
      reference region model (LSRRM), which accounts for time-dependent changes in 
      (18)F-fallypride displacement. Voxel-based statistical maps, representing specific 
      D2/3 binding changes, were computed to localize areas with increased ligand 
      displacement after Δ(9)-THC administration, reflecting dopamine release. While 
      Δ(9)-THC was not associated with dopamine release in the control group, significant 
      ligand displacement induced by Δ(9)-THC in striatal subregions, indicative of 
      dopamine release, was detected in both patients and relatives. This was most 
      pronounced in caudate nucleus. This is the first study to demonstrate differential 
      sensitivity to Δ(9)-THC in terms of increased endogenous dopamine release in 
      individuals at risk for psychosis.

TI  - Drug treatment presentations at a treatment centre in southern Nigeria (2015-2018): 
      Findings and implications for policy and practice.
PG  - 211-215
LID - 10.4103/npmj.npmj_36_19 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence suggests that rates of drug use and abuse in Nigeria 
      exceed the global average. There is a strong treatment demand for psychoactive drug 
      use disorders in Nigeria; however, it is not known whether available treatment 
      facilities are attending to the array of treatment needs. This audit compares the 
      pattern of presentations at a tertiary facility with a community-based survey. 
      METHODS: A review of cases (n = 212) seen at a regional drug treatment facility over 
      a 4-year period, using local data retrieved from the Nigerian Epidemiological 
      Network of Drug Use (NENDU) and comparison with data from the recently published 
      national drug use survey. RESULTS: Nine out of ten clients seen were male (93.4%). 
      About half (49.5%) of the clients used psychoactive substances for the first time 
      between ages 10 and 19 years. Cannabis was the primary drug of use overall and also 
      among males, while females were more likely to present with opiate abuse. Over half 
      had a co-occurring physical or mental disorder, and a minority had received testing 
      for hepatitis C in the past 12 months. CONCLUSION: Although patterns of drug abuse 
      presentations were consistent with findings from a national community-based survey, 
      there was an under-representation of females in treatment. Implications for policy 
      development and practice are discussed.

TI  - Brain Volume Correlates with Duration of Abstinence from Substance Abuse in a 
      Region-Specific and Substance-Specific Manner.
PG  - 626-635
LID - 10.1016/j.bpsc.2017.03.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human neuroimaging studies indicate that the loss of brain volume 
      associated with substance abuse may be recovered during abstinence. Subcortical and 
      prefrontal cortical regions involved in reward and decision-making are among the 
      regions most consistently implicated in damage and recovery from substance abuse, 
      but the relative capacities of these different brain regions to recover volume 
      during abstinence remains unclear, and it is unknown whether recovery capacities 
      depend on the substance that was abused. METHODS: Voxel-based morphometry in a 
      prison inmate sample (n=107) of long-term abstinent former regular users (FRUs) and 
      former light users (FLUs) of alcohol, cocaine, and/or cannabis. Cross-sectional 
      indicators of volume recovery were operationalized as 1) positive correlation 
      between abstinence duration and volume in FRUs and 2) absence of lower volume in 
      FRUs compared to FLUs. RESULTS: In FRUs of alcohol, abstinence duration positively 
      correlated with volume in subcortical regions (particularly the putamen and 
      amygdala) but not prefrontal regions; lower prefrontal but not subcortical volume 
      was observed in FRUs compared to FLUs. In FRUs of cocaine, abstinence duration 
      positively correlated with volume in both subcortical regions (particularly the 
      nucleus accumbens) and prefrontal regions; lower volume was not observed in either 
      subcortical or prefrontal regions in FRUs. In FRUs of cannabis, abstinence duration 
      positively correlated with subcortical but not prefrontal volume; lower prefrontal 
      but not subcortical volume was observed in FRUs. CONCLUSIONS: Subcortical structures 
      displayed indicators of volume recovery across FRUs of all three substances, whereas 
      prefrontal regions displayed indicators of volume recovery only in FRUs of cocaine.

TI  - The Belfast Youth Development Study (BYDS): A prospective cohort study of the 
      initiation, persistence and desistance of substance use from adolescence to 
      adulthood in Northern Ireland.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance misuse persists as a major public health issue worldwide with 
      significant costs for society. The development of interventions requires 
      methodologically sound studies to explore substance misuse causes and consequences. 
      This Cohort description paper outlines the design of the Belfast Youth Development 
      (BYDS), one of the largest cohort studies of its kind in the UK. The study was 
      established to address the need for a long-term prospective cohort study to 
      investigate the initiation, persistence and desistance of substance use, alongside 
      life course processes in adolescence and adulthood. The paper provides an overview 
      of BYDS as a longitudinal data source for investigating substance misuse and 
      outlines the study measures, sample retention and characteristics. We also outline 
      how the BYDS data have been used to date and highlight areas ripe for future work by 
      interested researchers. METHODS: The study began in 2000/1 when participants (n = 
      3,834) were pupils in their first year of post-primary education (age 10/11 years, 
      school year 8) from over 40 schools in Northern Ireland. Children were followed 
      during the school years: Year 9 (in 2002; aged 12; n = 4,343), Year 10 (in 2003; 
      aged 13; n = 4,522), Year 11 (in 2004; aged 14; n = 3,965) and Year 12 (in 2005; 
      aged 15; n = 3,830) and on two more occasions: 2006/07 (aged 16/17; n = 2,335) and 
      2010/11 (aged 20/21; n = 2,087). Data were collected on substance use, family, 
      schools, neighbourhoods, offending behaviour and mental health. The most novel 
      aspect of the study was the collection of detailed social network data via 
      friendship nominations allowing the investigation of the spread of substance use via 
      friendship networks. In 2004 (school year 11; respondents aged 14), a sub-sample of 
      participants' parents (n = 1,097) and siblings (n = 211) also completed measures on 
      substance use and family dynamics. RESULTS: The most recent wave (in 2010/2011; 
      respondents aged 20/21 years) indicated lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco and 
      cannabis among the cohort was 94, 70 and 45 per cent, respectively. The paper charts 
      the development of drug use behaviour and some of the key results to date are 
      presented. We have also identified a number of key areas ripe for analysis by 
      interested researchers including sexual health and education. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      established a cohort with detailed data from adolescence to young adulthood, 
      supplemented with parent and sibling reports and peer network data. The dataset, 
      allowing for investigation of trajectories of adolescent substance use, associated 
      factors and subsequent long-term outcomes, constitutes an important resource for 
      longitudinal substance misuse research. A planned further wave as the cohort enter 
      their late twenties and potential to link to administrative data sources, will 
      further enrich the datasets.

TI  - Lifetime methamphetamine dependence is associated with cerebral microgliosis in 
      HIV-1-infected adults.
PG  - 650-660
AB  - Methamphetamine (Meth) use is common among HIV-infected persons. It remains unclear 
      whether Meth dependence is associated with long-lasting degenerative changes in the 
      brain parenchyma and microvasculature of HIV-infected individuals. We examined the 
      postmortem brains of 78 HIV-infected adults, twenty of whom were diagnosed with 
      lifetime Meth dependence (18 past and two current at the final follow-up visit). 
      Using logistic regression models, we analyzed associations of Meth with cerebral 
      gliosis (immunohistochemistry for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1) 
      and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in frontal, temporo-parietal, and 
      putamen-internal capsule regions), synaptodendritic loss (confocal microscopy for 
      synaptophysin (SYP) and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) in frontal cortex), 
      β-amyloid plaque deposition (immunohistochemistry in frontal and temporo-parietal 
      cortex and putamen), and arteriolosclerosis (histopathology in forebrain white 
      matter). We found that Meth was associated with marked Iba1 gliosis in the 
      temporo-parietal region (odds ratio, 4.42 (95 % confidence interval, 1.36, 14.39), 
      p = 0.014, n = 62), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for HIV 
      encephalitis, white matter lesions, and opportunistic diseases (n = 61); hepatitis C 
      virus seropositivity (n = 54); and lifetime dependence on alcohol, opiates, and 
      cannabis (n = 62). There was no significant association of Meth with GFAP gliosis, 
      SYP or MAP2 loss, β-amyloid plaque deposition, or arteriolosclerosis. In conclusion, 
      we found lifetime Meth dependence to be associated with focal cerebral microgliosis 
      among HIV-infected adults, but not with other brain degenerative changes examined. 
      Some of the changes in select brain regions might be reversible following extended 
      Meth abstinence or, alternatively, might have not been induced by Meth initially.

      of gender.
PG  - 265-75
AB  - The aim of this paper is to make a descriptive analysis of Problematic Internet Use 
      in college students, evaluating the possible association with health problems and 
      addictive behaviors, as well as gender differences in user types. A total of 2,780 
      students participated in the study between 2011 and 2014, 29% of them being males 
      (age 20.8 ± 5.1 years) and 71% females (age 20.3 ± 4.4 years). The prevalence of 
      Problematic Internet Use (PIU) assessed by the Internet Addiction Test was 6.08%. 
      Being under 21 years of age and studying for degrees in subjects other than the 
      health sciences were associated factors with a higher frequency of this problem, no 
      differences by gender or type of address were found. The results show a significant 
      association with some health problems (migraines, back pain, excess weight or 
      obesity, insufficient rest), psychological aspects (risk of eating disorders, risk 
      of mental disorder, depression), family problems and discrimination; with no 
      associations with substance use (alcohol, cannabis or tobacco) being found. 
      Concerning the time of Internet use, weekly hours were significantly higher in women 
      than in men, both the total time as for leisure. The analysis of the profile use in 
      problematic users revealed that males are related to aspects of entertainment such 
      as games or shopping online and females are related to aspects of socialization, 
      such as chats and social networks.

TI  - Suicide Among Inuit: Results From a Large, Epidemiologically Representative 
      Follow-Back Study in Nunavut.
PG  - 268-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Inuit population in Canada's North has suffered from high rates of 
      death by suicide. We report on the first large-scale, controlled, epidemiologically 
      representative study of deaths by suicide in an Indigenous population, which 
      investigates risk factors for suicide among all Inuit across Nunavut who died by 
      suicide during a 4-year period. METHODS: We identified all suicides by Inuit (n = 
      120) that occurred between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2006, in Nunavut. For 
      each subject, we selected a community-matched control subject. We used proxy-based 
      procedures and conducted structured interviews with informants to obtain life 
      histories, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, 
      Axis I and II diagnoses, and measures of impulsive and (or) aggressive traits. 
      RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, subjects who died by suicide were more 
      likely to have experienced childhood abuse (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.08), have 
      family histories of major depressive disorder (P = 0.002) and suicide completion (P 
      = 0.02), and have been affected by major depressive disorder (OR 13.00; 95% CI 6.20 
      to 27.25), alcohol dependence (OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.59 to 5.24), or cannabis dependence 
      (OR 3.96; 95% CI 2.29 to 6.8) in the last 6 months. In addition, subjects who died 
      by suicide were more likely to have been affected with cluster B personality 
      disorders (OR 10.18; 95% CI 3.34 to 30.80) and had higher scores of impulsive and 
      aggressive traits (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: At the individual level, clinical risk 
      factors for suicide among Inuit are similar to those observed in studies with the 
      general population, and indicate a need for improved access to mental health 
      services. The high rate of mental health problems among control subjects suggests 
      the need for population-level mental health promotion.

AB  - While the detrimental effects of concurrent substance use disorders (SUDs) are now 
      being well documented, very few studies have examined this comorbidity among women 
      with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Data for these analyses were derived from 
      the "Women and Trauma" study conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment 
      Clinical Trials Network. Women with full or subthreshold PTSD and co-occurring 
      cannabis use disorder (CUD) and cocaine use disorder (COD; N=99) were compared to 
      their counterparts with co-occurring CUD only (N=26) and co-occurring COD only 
      (N=161) on rates of trauma exposure, psychiatric disorders, psychosocial problems, 
      and other substance use utilizing a set of multivariate logistic regressions. In 
      models adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women with PTSD and COD only were 
      significantly older than their counterparts with CUD only and concurrent CUD+COD. 
      Relative to those with CUD only, women with concurrent CUD+COD had higher odds of 
      adult sexual assault. Relative to those with COD only, women with concurrent CUD+COD 
      had higher odds of alcohol use disorder in the past 12months. Finally, relative to 
      those with CUD only, women with COD only had higher odds of ever being 
      arrested/convicted and adult sexual assault. The higher rates of adult sexual 
      assault and alcohol use disorder among those with concurrent CUD+COD suggest the 
      need for trauma-informed approaches that can respond to the needs of this 
      dually-diagnosed population. Moreover, the causal link between repeated traumatic 
      stress exposure and polysubstance use requires further examination.

TI  - Analysis of Parent Synthetic Cannabinoids in Blood and Urinary Metabolites by Liquid 
      Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 173-86
LID - 10.1093/jat/bkv137 [doi]
AB  - Synthetic cannabinoids emerged on the designer drug market in recent years due to 
      their ability to produce cannabis-like effects without the risk of detection by 
      traditional drug testing techniques such as immunoassay and gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry. As government agencies work to schedule existing synthetic 
      cannabinoids, new, unregulated and structurally diverse compounds continue to be 
      developed and sold. Synthetic cannabinoids undergo extensive metabolic conversion. 
      Consequently, both blood and urine specimens may play an important role in the 
      forensic analysis of synthetic cannabinoids. It has been observed that structurally 
      similar synthetic cannabinoids follow common metabolic pathways, which often produce 
      metabolites with similar metabolic transformations. Presented are two validated 
      quantitative methods for extracting and identifying 15 parent synthetic cannabinoids 
      in blood, 17 synthetic cannabinoid metabolites in urine and the qualitative 
      identification of 2 additional parent compounds. The linear range for most synthetic 
      cannabinoid compounds monitored was 0.1-10 ng/mL with the limit of detection between 
      0.01 and 0.5 ng/mL. Selectivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, recovery and 
      matrix effect were also examined and determined to be acceptable for each compound. 
      The validated methods were used to analyze a compilation of synthetic cannabinoid 
      investigative cases where both blood and urine specimens were submitted. The study 
      suggests a strong correlation between the metabolites detected in urine and the 
      parent compounds found in blood.

TI  - Evaluating the Long-Term Effectiveness of School-Based Depression, Anxiety, and 
      Substance Use Prevention Into Young Adulthood: Protocol for the Climate School 
      Combined Study.
PG  - e11372
LID - 10.2196/11372 [doi]
LID - e11372
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental health and substance use disorders are the leading causes of 
      global disability in children and youth. Both tend to first onset or escalate in 
      adolescence and young adulthood, calling for effective prevention during this time. 
      The Climate Schools Combined (CSC) study was the first trial of a Web-based combined 
      universal approach, delivered through school classes, to prevent both mental health 
      and substance use problems in adolescence. There is also limited evidence for the 
      cost-effectiveness of school-based prevention programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      protocol paper is to describe the CSC follow-up study, which aims to determine the 
      long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the CSC prevention program for 
      depression, anxiety, and substance use (alcohol and cannabis use) up to 7 years post 
      intervention. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial (the CSC study) was 
      conducted with 6386 participants aged approximately 13.5 years at baseline from 2014 
      to 2016. Participating schools were randomized to 1 of 4 conditions: (1) control 
      (health education as usual), (2) Climate Substance Use (universal substance use 
      prevention), (3) Climate Mental Health (universal mental health prevention), or (4) 
      CSC (universal substance use and mental health prevention). It was hypothesized that 
      the CSC program would be more effective than conditions (1) to (3) in reducing 
      alcohol and cannabis use (and related harms), anxiety, and depression symptoms as 
      well as increasing knowledge related to alcohol, cannabis, anxiety, and depression. 
      This long-term study will invite follow-up participants to complete 3 additional 
      Web-based assessments at approximately 5, 6, and 7 years post baseline using 
      multiple sources of locator information already provided to the research team. The 
      primary outcomes include alcohol and cannabis use (and related harms) and mental 
      health symptoms. An economic evaluation of the program will also be conducted using 
      both data linkage as well as self-report resource use and quality of life measures. 
      Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, social networks, peer substance use, 
      emotion regulation, and perfectionism. Analyses will be conducted using multilevel 
      mixed-effects models within an intention-to-treat framework. RESULTS: The CSC 
      long-term follow-up study is funded from 2018 to 2022 by the Australian National 
      Health and Medical Research Council (APP1143555). The first follow-up wave commences 
      in August 2018, and the results are expected to be submitted for publication in 
      2022. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a long-term evaluation of 
      combined universal substance use and mental health prevention up to 7 years post 
      intervention. Evidence of sustained benefits into early adulthood would provide a 
      scalable, easy-to-implement prevention strategy with the potential for widespread 
      dissemination to reduce the considerable harms, burden of disease, injury, and 
      social costs associated with youth substance use and mental disorders. INTERNATIONAL

TI  - Δ9-THC Intoxication by Cannabidiol-Enriched Cannabis Extract in Two Children with 
      Refractory Epilepsy: Full Remission after Switching to Purified Cannabidiol.
PG  - 359
LID - 359
AB  - Animal studies and preliminary clinical trials have shown that cannabidiol 
      (CBD)-enriched extracts may have beneficial effects for children with 
      treatment-resistant epilepsy. However, these compounds are not yet registered as 
      medicines by regulatory agencies. We describe the cases of two children with 
      treatment-resistant epilepsy (Case A with left frontal dysplasia and Case B with 
      Dravet Syndrome) with initial symptom improvement after the introduction of CBD 
      extracts followed by seizure worsening after a short time. The children presented 
      typical signs of intoxication by Δ9-THC (inappropriate laughter, ataxia, reduced 
      attention, and eye redness) after using a CBD-enriched extract. The extract was 
      replaced by the same dose of purified CBD with no Δ9-THC in both cases, which led to 
      improvement in intoxication signs and seizure remission. These cases support 
      pre-clinical and preliminary clinical evidence suggesting that CBD may be effective 
      for some patients with epilepsy. Moreover, the cases highlight the need for 
      randomized clinical trials using high-quality and reliable substances to ascertain 
      the safety and efficacy of cannabinoids as medicines.

      adolescents (BIS-11-A).
PG  - 274-282
LID - 10.1016/j.ijchp.2015.07.002 [doi]
AB  - Impulsivity has been associated with several psychiatric disorders such as substance 
      abuse. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is one of the most commonly 
      administered self-reports for the assessment of impulsiveness in both research and 
      clinical settings. There is a version for adolescents called BIS-11-A, which has not 
      been yet properly adapted to Spanish population. The goal of this study is to offer 
      an alternative and more adequate Spanish version of the BIS-1-A, as well as to 
      assess its psychometric properties including factor structure, reliability and 
      predictive validity regarding substance use (last month alcohol, tobacco and 
      cannabis use, presence of last month intoxication, binge drinking and problem 
      drinking). The BIS-11-A and items from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol 
      and other Drugs (ESPAD) were applied to1,183 students (aged 12-14) at 16 Spanish 
      secondary schools. The BIS-11-A showed a bidimensional factor structure, high 
      reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .87) and good capacity for identifying substance 
      use, binge drinking and problem drinking (sensitivity = 67.3-75%; 
      specificity = 83.4-85.4%). The BIS-11-A Spanish version is a reliable and valid 
      instrument for be used among early adolescents.

TI  - Examining the independent and joint effects of molecular genetic liability and 
      environmental exposures in schizophrenia: results from the EUGEI study.
PG  - 173-182
LID - 10.1002/wps.20629 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia is a heritable complex phenotype associated with a background risk 
      involving multiple common genetic variants of small effect and a multitude of 
      environmental exposures. Early twin and family studies using proxy-genetic liability 
      measures suggest gene-environment interaction in the etiology of schizophrenia 
      spectrum disorders, but the molecular evidence is scarce. Here, by analyzing the 
      main and joint associations of polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-SCZ) and 
      environmental exposures in 1,699 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum 
      disorders and 1,542 unrelated controls with no lifetime history of a diagnosis of 
      those disorders, we provide further evidence for gene-environment interaction in 
      schizophrenia. Evidence was found for additive interaction of molecular genetic risk 
      state for schizophrenia (binary mode of PRS-SCZ above 75% of the control 
      distribution) with the presence of lifetime regular cannabis use and exposure to 
      early-life adversities (sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and 
      bullying), but not with the presence of hearing impairment, season of birth (winter 
      birth), and exposure to physical abuse or physical neglect in childhood. The 
      sensitivity analyses replacing the a priori PRS-SCZ at 75% with alternative 
      cut-points (50% and 25%) confirmed the additive interaction. Our results suggest 
      that the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia involves genetic underpinnings that act 
      by making individuals more sensitive to the effects of some environmental exposures.

TI  - Internet-based attentional bias modification training as add-on to regular treatment 
      in alcohol and cannabis dependent outpatients: a study protocol of a randomized 
      control trial.
PG  - 193
LID - 10.1186/s12888-017-1359-2 [doi]
LID - 193
AB  - BACKGROUND: The automatic tendency to attend to and focus on substance-related cues 
      in the environment (attentional bias), has been found to contribute to the 
      persistence of addiction. Attentional bias modification (ABM) interventions might, 
      therefore, contribute to treatment outcome and the reduction of relapse rates. Based 
      on some promising research findings, we designed a study to test the clinical 
      relevance of ABM as an add-on component of regular intervention for alcohol and 
      cannabis patients. DESIGN/METHODS: The current protocol describes a study which will 
      investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed 
      home-delivered, multi-session, internet-based ABM (iABM) intervention as an add-on 
      to treatment as usual (TAU). TAU consists of cognitive behavioural therapy-based 
      treatment according to the Dutch guidelines for the treatment of addiction. 
      Participants (N = 213) will be outpatients from specialized addiction care 
      institutions diagnosed with alcohol or cannabis dependency who will be randomly 
      assigned to one of three conditions: TAU + iABM; TAU + placebo condition; TAU-only. 
      Primary outcome measures are substance use, craving, and rates of relapse. Changes 
      in attentional bias will be measured to investigate whether changes in primary 
      outcome measures can be attributed to the modification of attentional bias. Indices 
      of cost-effectiveness and secondary physical and psychological complaints 
      (depression, anxiety, and stress) are assessed as secondary outcome measures. 
      DISCUSSION: This randomized control trial will be the first to investigate whether a 
      home-delivered, multi-session iABM intervention is (cost-) effective in reducing 
      relapse rates in alcohol and cannabis dependency as an add-on to TAU, compared with 
      an active and a waiting list control group. If proven effective, this ABM 
      intervention could be easily implemented as a home-delivered component of current 
      TAU. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register, NTR5497 , registered on 18th

TI  - Alcohol and drug dependence symptom items as brief screeners for substance use 
      disorders: results from the Clinical Trials Network.
PG  - 360-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2011.12.002 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To address an urgent need for screening of substance use problems in medical 
      settings, we examined substance-specific dependence criteria as potential brief 
      screeners for the detection of patients with a substance use disorder (SUD). 
      METHODS: The sample included 920 opioid-dependent adults who were recruited from 
      outpatient treatment settings at 11 programs in 10 U.S. cities and who completed 
      intake assessments of SUDs for a multisite study of the National Drug Abuse 
      Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN003). Data were analyzed by factor analysis, 
      item response theory (IRT), sensitivity, and specificity procedures. RESULTS: Across 
      all substances (alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, sedatives), withdrawal was 
      among the least prevalent symptoms, while taking large amounts and inability to cut 
      down were among the most prevalent symptoms. Items closely related to the latent 
      trait of a SUD showed good-to-high values of area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve in identifying cases of a SUD; IRT-defined severe and less 
      discriminative items exhibited low sensitivity in identifying cases of a SUD 
      (withdrawal for all substances; time using for alcohol and sedatives; giving up 
      activities for sedatives). CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest that withdrawal and 
      time using are much less reliable indicators for a SUD than taking larger amounts 
      than intended and inability to cut down and that the latter two items should be 
      studied further for consideration in developing a simplified tool for screening 
      patients for SUDs in medical settings. These findings have implications for the use 
      of common health indicators in electronic health records systems to improve patient 
      care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify a potential core set of brief screeners for 
      the detection of individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD) in medical 
      settings. METHOD: Data were from two multisite studies that evaluated stimulant use 
      outcomes of an abstinence-based contingency management intervention as an addition 
      to usual care (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network trials 
      006-007). The sample comprised 847 substance-using adults who were recruited from 12 
      outpatient substance abuse treatment settings across the United States. Alcohol and 
      drug use disorders were assessed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders, Fourth Edition, Checklist. Data were analyzed by factor analysis, item 
      response theory (IRT), sensitivity and specificity procedures. RESULTS: 
      Comparatively prevalent symptoms of dependence, especially inability to cut down for 
      all substances, showed high sensitivity for detecting an SUD (low rate of false 
      negative). IRT-defined severe (infrequent) and low discriminative items, especially 
      withdrawal for alcohol, cannabis and cocaine, had low sensitivity in identifying 
      cases of an SUD. IRT-defined less severe (frequent) and high discriminative items, 
      including inability to cut down or taking larger amounts than intended for all 
      substances and withdrawal for amphetamines and opioids, showed good-to-high values 
      of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in classifying cases and 
      noncases of an SUD. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the feasibility of identifying 
      psychometrically reliable substance dependence symptoms to develop a two-item screen 
      for alcohol and drug disorders.

      Questionnaire Study Among Students.

LID - e19
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, drug prevention networks and drug education programs 
      have started using Web-based or mobile phone apps as novel prevention tools, testing 
      their efficacy compared with face-to-face prevention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study was to assess the potential of an interactive app called Once Upon a High 
      (VoltEgySzer). METHODS: The app approaches drug prevention from 6 different aspects, 
      and it addresses youngsters with 6 different modules: (1) interactive 
      comics/cartoons, telling stories of recovery; (2) quiz game; (3) roleplay game; (4) 
      introduction of psychoactive drugs; (5) information on the somatic and psychological 
      effects of psychoactive substances; (6) list of available treatment units, rehabs, 
      and self-support groups in Hungary. Students of 2 vocational schools and 2 high 
      schools filled out a questionnaire at a baseline (T0) and a 2-month follow-up (T1) 
      data collection session. Students of 1 vocational school and 1 high school 
      downloaded the Once Upon a High app (app group), whereas students from the other 
      vocational school and high school did not (nonapp group). The time points of T0 and 
      T1 questionnaires contained demographic variables, items with regard to substance 
      use characteristics for both legal and illegal substances, including novel 
      psychoactive substance, exercise habits, knowledge about psychoactive substances, 
      attitudes toward substance users and validated instruments measuring the severity of 
      tobacco (Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence), alcohol (Alcohol Use Disorder 
      Identification Test), cannabis (Cannabis Abuse Screening Test), and synthetic 
      cannabinoid consumption. Beliefs about substance use (Beliefs About Substance Abuse) 
      and perceived self-efficacy (General Perceived Self-Efficacy) were also measured. At 
      T1, members of the app group provided additional evaluation of the app. RESULTS: 
      There were 386 students who participated in the T0 session. After dropout, 246 
      students took part in T1 data collection procedure. Alcohol was the most frequently 
      consumed psychoactive substance (334/364, 91.8% lifetime use), followed by tobacco 
      (252/386, 65.3%, lifetime use) and cannabis (43/323, 13.3% lifetime use). Decreased 
      self-efficacy (beta=-.29, P=.04) and increased daily physical exercise frequencies 
      (beta=.04, P<.001) predicted higher frequencies of past month energy drink 
      consumption, whereas elevated past month alcohol consumption was mainly predicted by 
      a decrease in negative attitudes toward substance users (beta=-.13, P=.04) in the 
      regression models. Once Upon a High was found to be effective only in reducing 
      energy drink consumption (beta=-1.13, P=.04) after controlling for design effect, 
      whereas perceived utility of the app showed correlation with a decreasing alcohol 
      use (r(S(44))=.32, P=.03). The roleplay module of the app was found to be the most 
      preferred aspect of the app by the respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The Once Upon a High 
      app can be a useful tool to assist preventive intervention programs by increasing 
      knowledge and self-efficacy; however, its efficacy in reducing or preventing 
      substance use needs to be improved and further studied. Additional potential impacts 
      of the app need further testing.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Drug-related emergency department (ED) visits have steadily 
      increased, with substance users relying heavily on the ED for medical care. The 
      present study aims to identify clinical correlates of problematic drug use that 
      would facilitate identification of ED patients in need of substance use treatment. 
      METHODS: Using previously validated tests, 15,224 adult ED patients across 6 
      academic institutions were prescreened for drug use as part of a large randomized 
      prospective trial. Data for 3,240 participants who reported drug use in the past 30 
      days were included. Self-reported variables related to demographics, substance use, 
      and ED visit were examined to determine their correlative value for problematic drug 
      use. RESULTS: Of the 3,240 patients, 2,084 (64.3%) met criteria for problematic drug 
      use (Drug Abuse Screening Test score ≥ 3). Age greater than or equal to 30 years, 
      tobacco smoking, daily or binge alcohol drinking, daily drug use, primary 
      noncannabis drug use, resource-intense ED triage level, and perceived 
      drug-relatedness of ED visit were highly correlated with problematic drug use. Among 
      primary cannabis users, correlates of problematic drug use were age younger than 30 
      years, tobacco smoking, binge drinking, daily drug use, and perceived relatedness of 
      the ED visit to drug use. CONCLUSION: Clinical correlates of drug use problems may 
      assist the identification of ED patients who would benefit from comprehensive 
      screening, intervention, and referral to treatment. A clinical decision rule is 
      proposed. The correlation between problematic drug use and resource-intense ED 
      triage levels suggests that ED-based efforts to reduce the unmet need for substance 
      use treatment may help decrease overall health care costs.

TI  - CB1 cannabinoid receptor stimulation during adolescence impairs the maturation of 
      GABA function in the adult rat prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 536-43
LID - 10.1038/mp.2014.14 [doi]
AB  - Converging epidemiological studies indicate that cannabis abuse during adolescence 
      increases the risk of developing psychosis and prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent 
      cognitive impairments later in life. However, the mechanisms underlying the 
      adolescent susceptibility to chronic cannabis exposure are poorly understood. Given 
      that the psychoactive constituent of cannabis binds to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, 
      the present study was designed to determine the impact of a CB1 receptor agonist 
      (WIN) during specific windows of adolescence on the functional maturation of the rat 
      PFC. By means of local field potential recordings and ventral hippocampal 
      stimulation in vivo, we found that a history of WIN exposure during early (postnatal 
      days - P35-40) or mid-(P40-45) adolescence, but not in late adolescence (P50-55) or 
      adulthood (P75-80), is sufficient to yield a state of frequency-dependent prefrontal 
      disinhibition in adulthood comparable to that seen in the juvenile PFC. Remarkably, 
      this prefrontal disinhibition could be normalized following a single acute local 
      infusion of the GABA-Aα1 positive allosteric modulator Indiplon, suggesting that 
      adolescent exposure to WIN causes a functional downregulation of GABAergic 
      transmission in the PFC. Accordingly, in vitro recordings from adult rats exposed to 
      WIN during adolescence demonstrate that local prefrontal GABAergic transmission onto 
      layer V pyramidal neurons is markedly reduced to the level seen in the P30-35 PFC. 
      Together, these results indicate that early and mid-adolescence constitute a 
      critical period during which repeated CB1 receptor stimulation is sufficient to 
      elicit an enduring state of PFC network disinhibition resulting from a developmental 
      impairment of local prefrontal GABAergic transmission.

TI  - Evidence that environmental and genetic risks for psychotic disorder may operate by 
      impacting on connections between core symptoms of perceptual alteration and 
      delusional ideation.
PG  - 687-97
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbu122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relational models of psychopathology propose that symptoms are 
      dynamically connected and hypothesize that genetic and environmental influences 
      moderate the strength of these symptom connections. Previous findings suggest that 
      the interplay between hallucinations and delusions may play a crucial role in the 
      development of psychotic disorder. The current study examined whether the connection 
      between hallucinations and delusions is impacted by proxy genetic and environmental 
      risk factors. METHODS: Hallucinations and delusions at baseline and at 3-year 
      follow-up were assessed in a sample of 1054 healthy siblings and 918 parents of 1109 
      patients with psychosis, and in 589 healthy controls (no familial psychosis risk). 
      Environmental factors assessed were cannabis use, childhood trauma, and urbanicity 
      during childhood. Logistic regression analyses tested whether familial psychosis 
      risk predicted increased risk of delusions, given presence of hallucinations. 
      Moderating effects of environmental factors on the hallucination-delusion 
      association were tested in a similar fashion, restricted to the control and sibling 
      groups. RESULTS: The risk of delusions, given hallucinations, was associated with 
      proxy genetic risk: 53% in parents, 47% in siblings, and 36% in controls. The 
      hallucination-delusion association was stronger in those reporting cannabis use 
      (risk difference: 32%) and childhood trauma (risk difference: 15%) although not all 
      associations were statistically conclusive (respectively: p = .037; p = .054). A 
      directionally similar but nonsignificant effect was found for urb anicity during 
      childhood (risk difference: 14%, p =.357). CONCLUSION: The strength of the 
      connection between delusions and hallucinations is associated with familial and 
      environmental risks for psychotic disorder, suggesting that specific symptom 
      connections in the early psychosis psychopathology network are informative of 
      underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Drug use and health behaviour among German men who have sex with men: Results of a 
      qualitative, multi-centre study.
PG  - 36
LID - 36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a risk group for new HIV infections. 
      Drug use among men who have sex with men is often accompanied by risky sexual 
      behaviours. Local AIDS help centres and gay advice centres are recording an increase 
      in drug use among MSM clients in Germany. This study examines reasons for drug use 
      and drug use contexts for MSM, including syndemic factors and experiences of social 
      support. METHODS: The study is based on a qualitative research approach. We 
      conducted 14 structured, in-depth interviews with substance-using MSM in three 
      German cities. An interview guidance document was used that was developed on the 
      basis of the syndemic approach. Data analysis was based on structured analysis of 
      content. RESULTS: The MSM interviewed had extensive experience of drug use, in 
      particular amyl nitrate, amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, cocaine and 
      cannabis. The drugs were used both at parties and in connection with sexual 
      experiences (chemsex). Twelve men said that they had an existing HIV infection at 
      the time of the interview. The men also reported experiences of violence and 
      discrimination because of their sexual orientation. The social networks of the MSM 
      and dating apps are highly relevant for experiencing chemsex. Certain places in the 
      MSM community also have an impact on drug purchase, drug consumption and chemsex 
      sessions. CONCLUSIONS: MSM are a group that is vulnerable to psychological problems, 
      in particular problematic drug use. This group requires specific help from drug 
      services and AIDS support services that are orientated towards the life situation 
      and substance use contexts of the clients. Both support systems should work together 
      more closely and network. Furthermore, specific prevention strategies, aimed at both 
      mental and physical well-being, should be developed for substance-using MSM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to assess the importance of environmental and genetic risk on 
      transition from health to psychotic disorder, a prospective study of individuals at 
      average (n = 462) and high genetic risk (n = 810) was conducted. METHOD: A 
      three-year cohort study examined the rate of transition to psychotic disorder. 
      Binary measures indexing environmental exposure (combining urban birth, cannabis 
      use, ethnicity and childhood trauma) and proxy genetic risk (high-risk sibling 
      status) were used to model transition. RESULTS: The majority of high-risk siblings 
      (68%) and healthy comparison subjects (60%) had been exposed to one or more 
      environmental risks. The risk of transition in siblings (n = 9, 1.1%) was higher 
      than the risk in healthy comparison subjects (n = 2, 0.4%; OR(adj) = 
      2.2,95%CI:5-10.3). All transitions (100%) were associated with environmental 
      exposure, compared to 65% of non-transitions (p = 0.014), with the greatest effects 
      for childhood trauma (OR(adj) = 34.4,95%CI:4.4-267.4), cannabis use (OR = 
      4.1,95%CI:1.1, 15.4), minority ethnic group (OR = 3.8,95%CI:1.2,12.8) and urban 
      birth (OR = 3.7,95%CI:0.9,15.4). The proportion of transitions in the population 
      attributable to environmental and genetic risk ranged from 28% for minority ethnic 
      group, 45% for urban birth, 57% for cannabis use, 86% for childhood trauma, and 50% 
      for high-risk sibling status. Nine out of 11 transitions (82%) were exposed to both 
      genetic and environmental risk, compared to only 43% of non-transitions (p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Environmental risk associated with transition to psychotic disorder is 
      semi-ubiquitous regardless of genetic high risk status. Careful prospective 
      documentation suggests most transitions can be attributed to powerful environmental 
      effects that become detectable when analysed against elevated background genetic 
      risk, indicating gene-environment interaction.

TI  - Rapid situational assessment of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Nairobi and 
      coastal regions of Kenya: a respondent driven sampling survey.
PG  - 1549

AB  - BACKGROUND: A Cross-sectional Rapid Situational Assessment of People Who Inject Drug 
      (PWIDs) applying Respondent Driven sampling techniques (RDS) was used to recruit 
      subjects/participants in a study aimed at assessing HIV prevalence and risk 
      behaviors among injecting drug users in Nairobi and Coastal regions of Kenya. There 
      is paucity of data and information on injecting drug use in sub-Saharan Africa and 
      there is sufficient evidence of existence of the environment for development and 
      growth of injecting drug use. Past studies on PWID and its association to HIV and 
      AIDS that have been conducted in Kenya do not provide sufficient information to 
      support effective planning and comprehensive national response to the HIV and AIDS 
      epidemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was adopted in which a set of 
      initial subjects referred to as 'seeds' were first identified from which an 
      expanding chain of referrals were obtained, with subjects from each wave referring 
      subjects of subsequent waves. The seeds were drawn randomly from the population and 
      interviewed to pick the one with the largest network and other unique 
      characteristics. A maximum of twelve seeds were recruited. The second stage involved 
      conducting assessment visits to the sites to identify potential collaborators that 
      included non-governmental organizations (NGOs), drug treatment centres, health 
      facilities, community based organizations (CBO's) among others. Three NGOs located 
      in the coast region and one in Nairobi region were identified to assist in 
      identifying drug injection locations and potential participants. Key informant 
      interviews (KIIs) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were also conducted using 
      interview guides. RESULTS: A total of 646 individuals (344 in Nairobi and 302 at the 
      coast) were recruited for the study between January and March 2010. Of these 590 
      (91%) were male and 56 (9%) were female. Findings showed that most PWIDs initiated 
      injecting drug use between the ages of 20-29 years, with the youngest age of 
      initiation being 11 years and oldest age being 53 years. Most commonly injected drug 
      was heroin (98%), with a small (2%) percentage injecting cocaine. Other 
      non-injecting methods such as smoking or combining these two drugs with other drugs 
      such as cannabis or Rohypnol were also common. Most PWIDs used other substances 
      (cigarettes, alcohol, and cannabis) before initiating injecting drug use. The 
      adjusted national HIV prevalence of PWIDs was 18.3% (19.62% unadjusted) with PWIDs 
      in Nairobi region registering 18.33% (20.58% unadjusted) compared PWIDs for Coastal 
      region indicating 18.27% (18.59% - unadjusted). The gender based HIV prevalence 
      showed that women were more at risk of acquiring HIV (44.51%-adjusted) compared to 
      men (15.97%-adjusted). The age specific HIV prevalence showed that PWIDs who 
      initiated injecting at 11-19 years (44.7% adjusted) were most at risk in Nairobi 
      compared to those who initiated injecting at age 20-24 years (23.2% - adjusted) in 
      the coastal region. While all PWIDs continue to be at risk in the two regions, those 
      from the Western parts of Nairobi, Kenya were at a relatively higher risk given 
      their increased propensity for sharing injecting equipment and solutions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the national HIV prevalence of (4.9%), the results show 
      that People Who Inject Drugs (PWIDs) are at particularly high risk of infection in 
      Kenya and there is urgent need for intervention (KenPHIA, 2018). This study also 
      showed clear evidence that 70% of PWIDs are primary school educated, engage in high 
      risk injecting and sexual behaviors comprising sharing of injecting equipment, 
      unprotected heterosexual and homosexual sex. Given that initiation of injecting drug 
      use begins early and peaks after formal school years (20-29 years), prevention 
      programmes should be targeted at primary and secondary school students, college and 
      out of school youth. Further, to protect People who inject drugs (PWIDs) from HIV 
      infection, the country should introduce free Needle Syringe Programs (NSP) with 
      provision of condoms and Methadone Assisted Therapy (MAT) as a substitute for drug 
      use.

TI  - Evidence that psychotic symptoms are prevalent in disorders of anxiety and 
      depression, impacting on illness onset, risk, and severity--implications for 
      diagnosis and ultra-high risk research.
PG  - 247-57
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbr196 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is commonly assumed that there are clear lines of demarcation between 
      anxiety and depressive disorders on the one hand and psychosis on the other. Recent 
      evidence, however, suggests that this principle may be in need of updating. METHODS: 
      Depressive and/or anxiety disorders, with no previous history of psychotic disorder, 
      were examined for the presence of psychotic symptoms in a representative community 
      sample of adolescents and young adults (Early Developmental Stages of 
      Psychopathology study; n = 3021). Associations and consequences of psychotic 
      symptomatology in the course of these disorders were examined in terms of 
      demographic distribution, illness severity, onset of service use, and risk factors. 
      RESULTS: Around 27% of those with disorders of anxiety and depression displayed one 
      or more psychotic symptoms, vs 14% in those without these disorders (OR 2.23, 95% CI 
      1.89-2.66, P < .001). Presence as compared with nonpresence of psychotic 
      symptomatology was associated with younger age (P < .0001), male sex (P < .0058), 
      and poorer illness course (P < .0002). In addition, there was greater persistence of 
      schizotypal (P < .0001) and negative symptoms (P < .0170), more observable illness 
      behavior (P < .0001), greater likelihood of service use (P < .0069), as well as more 
      evidence of familial liability for mental illness (P < .0100), exposure to trauma (P 
      < .0150), recent and more distant life events (P < .0006-.0244), cannabis use (P < 
      .0009), and any drug use (P < .0008). CONCLUSION: Copresence of psychotic 
      symptomatology in disorders of anxiety and depression is common and a functionally 
      and etiologically highly relevant feature, reinforcing the view that psychopathology 
      is represented by a network or overlapping and reciprocally impacting dimensional 
      liabilities.

TI  - What factors determine Belgian general practitioners' approaches to detecting and 
      managing substance abuse? A qualitative study based on the I-Change Model.
PG  - 119
LID - 10.1186/1471-2296-15-119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) are considered to play a major role in 
      detecting and managing substance abuse. However, little is known about how or why 
      they decide to manage it. This study investigated the factors that influence GP 
      behaviours with regard to the abuse of alcohol, illegal drugs, hypnotics, and 
      tranquilisers among working Belgians. METHODS: Twenty Belgian GPs were interviewed. 
      De Vries' Integrated Change Model was used to guide the interviews and qualitative 
      data analyses. RESULTS: GPs perceived higher levels of substance abuse in urban 
      locations and among lower socioeconomic groups. Guidelines, if they existed, were 
      primarily used in Flanders. Specific training was unevenly applied but considered 
      useful. GPs who accepted abuse management cited strong interpersonal skills and 
      available multidisciplinary networks as facilitators.GPs relied on their clinical 
      common sense to detect abuse or initiate management. Specific patients' situations 
      and their social, psychological, or professional dysfunctions were cited as cues to 
      action.GPs were strongly influenced by their personal representations of abuse, 
      which included the balance between their professional responsibilities toward their 
      patients and the patients' responsibilities in managing their own health as well the 
      GPs' abilities to cope with unsatisfying patient outcomes without reaching 
      professional exhaustion. GPs perceived substance abuse along a continuum ranging 
      from a chronic disease (whose management was part of their responsibility) to a 
      moral failing of untrustworthy people. Alcohol and cannabis were more socially 
      acceptable than other drugs. Personal experiences of emotional burdens (including 
      those regarding substance abuse) increased feelings of empathy or rejection toward 
      patients.Multidisciplinary practices and professional experiences were cited as 
      important factors with regard to engaging GPs in substance abuse management. Time 
      constraints and personal investments were cited as important barriers.Satisfaction 
      with treatment was rare. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational factors, including subjective 
      beliefs not supported by the literature, were central in deciding whether to manage 
      cases of substance abuse. A lack of theoretical knowledge and training were 
      secondary to personal attitudes and motivation. Personal development, emotional 
      health, self-awareness, and self-care should be taught to and fostered among GPs to 
      help them maintain a patient-centred focus. Health authorities should support 
      collaborative care.

TI  - [Core research areas on addiction in Spain through the Web of Science bibliographic 
      coupling analysis (2000-2013)].
PG  - 168-83
AB  - The present study identifies the main Spanish core research areas in the area of 
      addictions through the bibliographic coupling analysis of the publications at the 
      Web of Science under the substance abuse heading. The bibliographic coupling 
      methodology is the analytical procedure that determines the thematic-intellectual 
      proximity of the documents under consideration through the identification of the 
      shared or simultaneously cited bibliography by those documents. A factor analysis 
      and network analysis have been carried out to cluster documents, graphically 
      represent the existing core research areas, and analyse the interrelations between 
      them. We have identified 30 core research areas. Alcohol is the topic of attention 
      of 17 areas and cocaine has a strong presence in 6. Heroin and opiates are only 
      present as prominent substances in 4 areas and cannabis and tobacco in other two for 
      each substance. It has been found that there is a significant degree of 
      fragmentation in the area, with the existence of numerous research foci but with few 
      connections with each other and few documents showing shared common knowledge. Also 
      noteworthy is the large number of emerging research areas, reflecting an incipient 
      stage in many of the research topics. Consideration must be placed in promoting 
      scientific consensus and cohesion of the discipline as well as to encouraging the 
      consolidation of main lines that respond to the social problems and research 
      challenges.
